(2 Chronicles,10,2,And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,3,And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying,~)
(2 Chronicles,10,4,Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,5,And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,6,And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?~)
(2 Chronicles,10,7,And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,8,But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,9,And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?~)
(2 Chronicles,10,10,And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,11,For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,12,So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.~)
(2 Chronicles,10,13,And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,~)

(2 Chronicles,10,17,But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.~)

(2 Chronicles,11,2,But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,~)
(2 Chronicles,11,3,Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,~)
(2 Chronicles,11,4,Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,5,And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,6,He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,~)
(2 Chronicles,11,7,And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,~)
(2 Chronicles,11,8,And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,~)
(2 Chronicles,11,9,And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,~)
(2 Chronicles,11,10,And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,11,And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,12,And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,13,And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,14,For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:~)
(2 Chronicles,11,15,And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,16,And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,17,So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,18,And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;~)
(2 Chronicles,11,19,Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,20,And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,21,And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)~)
(2 Chronicles,11,22,And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.~)
(2 Chronicles,11,23,And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,1,And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,2,And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,~)
(2 Chronicles,12,3,With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,4,And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,5,Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,6,Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,7,And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,8,Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,9,So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,10,Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,11,And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,12,And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,13,So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,14,And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,15,Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.~)
(2 Chronicles,12,16,And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,1,Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,2,He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,3,And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,4,And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;~)
(2 Chronicles,13,5,Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?~)
(2 Chronicles,13,6,Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,7,And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,8,And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,9,Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,10,But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:~)
(2 Chronicles,13,11,And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,12,And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,13,But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,14,And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,15,Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,16,And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,17,And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,18,Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,19,And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,20,Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,21,But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.~)
(2 Chronicles,13,22,And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,1,So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,2,And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:~)
(2 Chronicles,14,3,For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:~)
(2 Chronicles,14,4,And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,5,Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,6,And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,7,Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,8,And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,9,And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,10,Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,11,And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,12,So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,13,And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,14,And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.~)
(2 Chronicles,14,15,They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,1,And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:~)
(2 Chronicles,15,2,And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,3,Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,4,But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,5,And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,6,And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,7,Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,8,And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,9,And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,10,So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,11,And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,12,And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;~)
(2 Chronicles,15,13,That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,14,And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,15,And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,16,And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,17,But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,18,And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.~)
(2 Chronicles,15,19,And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,1,In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,2,Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,~)
(2 Chronicles,16,3,There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,4,And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,5,And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,6,Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,7,And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,8,Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,9,For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.~)
(2 Chronicles,16,10,Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.~)

(2 Chronicles,16,14,And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.~)

(2 Chronicles,24,7,For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,8,And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,9,And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,10,And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,11,Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,12,And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,13,So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,14,And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,15,But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,16,And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,17,Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,18,And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,19,Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,20,And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,21,And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,22,Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,23,And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,24,For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,25,And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,26,And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.~)
(2 Chronicles,24,27,Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,1,Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,2,And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,3,Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,4,But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,5,Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,6,He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,7,But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,8,But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,9,And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,10,Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,11,And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,12,And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,13,But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,14,Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,15,Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand?~)
(2 Chronicles,25,16,And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,17,Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,18,And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,19,Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?~)
(2 Chronicles,25,20,But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,21,So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,22,And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,23,And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,24,And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,25,And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,26,Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?~)
(2 Chronicles,25,27,Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.~)
(2 Chronicles,25,28,And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.~)

(2 Chronicles,26,3,Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,4,And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,5,And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,6,And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,7,And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,8,And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,9,Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,10,Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,11,Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,12,The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,13,And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,14,And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,15,And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,16,But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,17,And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:~)
(2 Chronicles,26,18,And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,19,Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,20,And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,21,And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,22,Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.~)
(2 Chronicles,26,23,So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Chronicles,27,1,Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.~)

(2 Chronicles,27,3,He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.~)
(2 Chronicles,27,4,Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.~)
(2 Chronicles,27,5,He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.~)
(2 Chronicles,27,6,So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.~)

(2 Chronicles,28,1,Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:~)
(2 Chronicles,28,2,For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim.~)

(2 Chronicles,28,4,He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,5,Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,6,For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.~)

(2 Chronicles,28,10,And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?~)
(2 Chronicles,28,11,Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,12,Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war,~)
(2 Chronicles,28,13,And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,14,So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,15,And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,16,At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,17,For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,18,The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,19,For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,20,And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,21,For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,22,And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,23,For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,24,And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,25,And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,26,Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,28,27,And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,1,Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.~)

(2 Chronicles,29,6,For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,7,Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,8,Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.~)

(2 Chronicles,29,11,My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,12,Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:~)
(2 Chronicles,29,13,And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:~)

(2 Chronicles,29,15,And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,16,And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,17,Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,18,Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,19,Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,20,Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,21,And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,22,So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,23,And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:~)
(2 Chronicles,29,24,And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,25,And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,26,And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,27,And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,28,And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,29,And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,30,Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,31,Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,32,And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,33,And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,34,But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,35,And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.~)
(2 Chronicles,29,36,And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.~)
(2 Chronicles,30,1,And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.~)
(2 Chronicles,30,2,For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.~)
(2 Chronicles,30,3,For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Chronicles,30,4,And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.~)
(2 Chronicles,30,5,So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.~)

(Jeremiah,33,11,The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.~)

(Jeremiah,33,17,For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;~)
(Jeremiah,33,18,Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.~)
(Jeremiah,33,19,And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,33,20,Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;~)
(Jeremiah,33,21,Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.~)
(Jeremiah,33,22,As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.~)
(Jeremiah,33,23,Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,33,24,Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.~)
(Jeremiah,33,25,Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;~)
(Jeremiah,33,26,Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.~)

(Jeremiah,34,10,Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.~)
(Jeremiah,34,11,But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.~)
(Jeremiah,34,12,Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,34,13,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,34,14,At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.~)
(Jeremiah,34,15,And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:~)
(Jeremiah,34,16,But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.~)
(Jeremiah,34,17,Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.~)

(Jeremiah,35,5,And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.~)

(Jeremiah,35,12,Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,35,13,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.~)
(Jeremiah,35,14,The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.~)
(Jeremiah,35,15,I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.~)
(Jeremiah,35,16,Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:~)
(Jeremiah,35,17,Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.~)
(Jeremiah,35,18,And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:~)
(Jeremiah,35,19,Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.~)
(Jeremiah,36,1,And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,36,2,Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.~)
(Jeremiah,36,3,It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.~)
(Jeremiah,36,4,Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.~)
(Jeremiah,36,5,And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:~)
(Jeremiah,36,6,Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.~)
(Jeremiah,36,7,It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.~)
(Jeremiah,36,8,And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD's house.~)
(Jeremiah,36,9,And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.~)
(Jeremiah,36,10,Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.~)
(Jeremiah,36,11,When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,~)
(Jeremiah,36,12,Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.~)
(Jeremiah,36,13,Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.~)
(Jeremiah,36,14,Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.~)
(Jeremiah,36,15,And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.~)
(Jeremiah,36,16,Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.~)
(Jeremiah,36,17,And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?~)
(Jeremiah,36,18,Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.~)
(Jeremiah,36,19,Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.~)
(Jeremiah,36,20,And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.~)
(Jeremiah,36,21,So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.~)
(Jeremiah,36,22,Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.~)
(Jeremiah,36,23,And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.~)
(Jeremiah,36,24,Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.~)
(Jeremiah,36,25,Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.~)
(Jeremiah,36,26,But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.~)
(Jeremiah,36,27,Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,36,28,Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.~)
(Jeremiah,36,29,And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?~)
(Jeremiah,36,30,Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.~)
(Jeremiah,36,31,And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.~)
(Jeremiah,36,32,Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.~)
(Jeremiah,37,1,And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.~)
(Jeremiah,37,2,But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.~)
(Jeremiah,37,3,And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.~)
(Jeremiah,37,4,Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.~)
(Jeremiah,37,5,Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.~)
(Jeremiah,37,6,Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying,~)
(Jeremiah,37,7,Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.~)
(Jeremiah,37,8,And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.~)
(Jeremiah,37,9,Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.~)
(Jeremiah,37,10,For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.~)
(Jeremiah,37,11,And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,~)
(Jeremiah,37,12,Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.~)
(Jeremiah,37,13,And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.~)
(Jeremiah,37,14,Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.~)
(Jeremiah,37,15,Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.~)
(Jeremiah,37,16,When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;~)
(Jeremiah,37,17,Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.~)
(Jeremiah,37,18,Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?~)
(Jeremiah,37,19,Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?~)
(Jeremiah,37,20,Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.~)
(Jeremiah,37,21,Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.~)
(Jeremiah,38,1,Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,38,2,Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.~)
(Jeremiah,38,3,Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.~)
(Jeremiah,38,4,Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.~)
(Jeremiah,38,5,Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.~)
(Jeremiah,38,6,Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.~)
(Jeremiah,38,7,Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;~)
(Jeremiah,38,8,Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,~)
(Jeremiah,38,9,My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.~)
(Jeremiah,38,10,Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.~)
(Jeremiah,38,11,So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.~)
(Jeremiah,38,12,And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.~)
(Jeremiah,38,13,So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.~)
(Jeremiah,38,14,Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.~)
(Jeremiah,38,15,Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?~)
(Jeremiah,38,16,So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.~)
(Jeremiah,38,17,Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:~)
(Jeremiah,38,18,But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.~)
(Jeremiah,38,19,And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.~)
(Jeremiah,38,20,But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.~)
(Jeremiah,38,21,But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:~)
(Jeremiah,38,22,And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.~)
(Jeremiah,38,23,So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.~)
(Jeremiah,38,24,Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.~)
(Jeremiah,38,25,But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:~)
(Jeremiah,38,26,Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.~)
(Jeremiah,38,27,Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.~)
(Jeremiah,38,28,So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.~)
(Jeremiah,39,1,In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.~)
(Jeremiah,39,2,And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.~)
(Jeremiah,39,3,And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.~)
(Jeremiah,39,4,And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.~)
(Jeremiah,39,5,But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.~)
(Jeremiah,39,6,Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.~)
(Jeremiah,39,7,Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.~)
(Jeremiah,39,8,And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.~)
(Jeremiah,39,9,Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.~)
(Jeremiah,39,10,But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.~)
(Jeremiah,39,11,Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,39,12,Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.~)
(Jeremiah,39,13,So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;~)
(Jeremiah,39,14,Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.~)
(Jeremiah,39,15,Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,~)
(Jeremiah,39,16,Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.~)
(Jeremiah,39,17,But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.~)
(Jeremiah,39,18,For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.~)
(Jeremiah,40,1,The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.~)
(Jeremiah,40,2,And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.~)
(Jeremiah,40,3,Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.~)
(Jeremiah,40,4,And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.~)
(Jeremiah,40,5,Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.~)
(Jeremiah,40,6,Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.~)
(Jeremiah,40,7,Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;~)
(Jeremiah,40,8,Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.~)
(Jeremiah,40,9,And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.~)
(Jeremiah,40,10,As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.~)
(Jeremiah,40,11,Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;~)
(Jeremiah,40,12,Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.~)
(Jeremiah,40,13,Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,~)
(Jeremiah,40,14,And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.~)
(Jeremiah,40,15,Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?~)
(Jeremiah,40,16,But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.~)
(Jeremiah,41,1,Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.~)
(Jeremiah,41,2,Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.~)
(Jeremiah,41,3,Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.~)
(Jeremiah,41,4,And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,~)
(Jeremiah,41,5,That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.~)
(Jeremiah,41,6,And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.~)
(Jeremiah,41,7,And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.~)
(Jeremiah,41,8,But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.~)
(Jeremiah,41,9,Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.~)
(Jeremiah,41,10,Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.~)
(Jeremiah,41,11,But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,~)
(Jeremiah,41,12,Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.~)
(Jeremiah,41,13,Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.~)
(Jeremiah,41,14,So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.~)
(Jeremiah,41,15,But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.~)
(Jeremiah,41,16,Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:~)
(Jeremiah,41,17,And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,~)
(Jeremiah,41,18,Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.~)
(Jeremiah,42,1,Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,~)
(Jeremiah,42,2,And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)~)
(Jeremiah,42,3,That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.~)
(Jeremiah,42,4,Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.~)
(Jeremiah,42,5,Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.~)
(Jeremiah,42,6,Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.~)
(Jeremiah,42,7,And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.~)
(Jeremiah,42,8,Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,~)
(Jeremiah,42,9,And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;~)
(Jeremiah,42,10,If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.~)
(Jeremiah,42,11,Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.~)

(Ecclesiastes,6,2,A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.~)

(Ecclesiastes,11,5,As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.~)
(Ecclesiastes,11,6,In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.~)
(Ecclesiastes,11,7,Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:~)
(Ecclesiastes,11,8,But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.~)
(Ecclesiastes,11,9,Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.~)
(Ecclesiastes,11,10,Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.~)
(Ecclesiastes,12,1,Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;~)

(Ecclesiastes,12,5,Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:~)
(Ecclesiastes,12,6,Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.~)

(Ecclesiastes,12,8,Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.~)
(Ecclesiastes,12,9,And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs.~)
(Ecclesiastes,12,10,The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was upright, even words of truth.~)
(Ecclesiastes,12,11,The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.~)
(Ecclesiastes,12,12,And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.~)

(Ecclesiastes,12,14,For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.~)
(Daniel,1,1,In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.~)
(Daniel,1,2,And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.~)
(Daniel,1,3,And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;~)
(Daniel,1,4,Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.~)
(Daniel,1,5,And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.~)
(Daniel,1,6,Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:~)
(Daniel,1,7,Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.~)
(Daniel,1,8,But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.~)
(Daniel,1,9,Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.~)
(Daniel,1,10,And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.~)
(Daniel,1,11,Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,~)
(Daniel,1,12,Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.~)
(Daniel,1,13,Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.~)
(Daniel,1,14,So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.~)
(Daniel,1,15,And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.~)
(Daniel,1,16,Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.~)
(Daniel,1,17,As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.~)
(Daniel,1,18,Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.~)
(Daniel,1,19,And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.~)
(Daniel,1,20,And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.~)
(Daniel,1,21,And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.~)
(Daniel,2,1,And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.~)
(Daniel,2,2,Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.~)
(Daniel,2,3,And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.~)
(Daniel,2,4,Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.~)
(Daniel,2,5,The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.~)
(Daniel,2,6,But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.~)
(Daniel,2,7,They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.~)
(Daniel,2,8,The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.~)
(Daniel,2,9,But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.~)
(Daniel,2,10,The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.~)
(Daniel,2,11,And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.~)
(Daniel,2,12,For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.~)
(Daniel,2,13,And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.~)
(Daniel,2,14,Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:~)
(Daniel,2,15,He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.~)
(Daniel,2,16,Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.~)
(Daniel,2,17,Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:~)
(Daniel,2,18,That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.~)
(Daniel,2,19,Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.~)
(Daniel,2,20,Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:~)
(Daniel,2,21,And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:~)
(Daniel,2,22,He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.~)
(Daniel,2,23,I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.~)
(Daniel,2,24,Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.~)
(Daniel,2,25,Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.~)
(Daniel,2,26,The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?~)
(Daniel,2,27,Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;~)
(Daniel,2,28,But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;~)
(Daniel,2,29,As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.~)
(Daniel,2,30,But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.~)
(Daniel,2,31,Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible.~)
(Daniel,2,32,This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,~)
(Daniel,2,33,His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.~)
(Daniel,2,34,Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.~)
(Daniel,2,35,Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.~)
(Daniel,2,36,This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.~)
(Daniel,2,37,Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.~)
(Daniel,2,38,And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.~)
(Daniel,2,39,And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.~)
(Daniel,2,40,And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.~)
(Daniel,2,41,And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.~)
(Daniel,2,42,And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.~)
(Daniel,2,43,And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.~)
(Daniel,2,44,And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.~)
(Daniel,2,45,Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.~)
(Daniel,2,46,Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.~)
(Daniel,2,47,The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.~)
(Daniel,2,48,Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.~)
(Daniel,2,49,Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.~)
(Daniel,3,1,Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.~)
(Daniel,3,2,Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.~)
(Daniel,3,3,Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.~)
(Daniel,3,4,Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,~)
(Daniel,3,5,That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:~)
(Daniel,3,6,And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.~)
(Daniel,3,7,Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.~)
(Daniel,3,8,Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.~)
(Daniel,3,9,They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.~)
(Daniel,3,10,Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:~)
(Daniel,3,11,And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.~)
(Daniel,3,12,There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.~)
(Daniel,3,13,Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.~)
(Daniel,3,14,Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?~)
(Daniel,3,15,Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?~)
(Daniel,3,16,Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.~)
(Daniel,3,17,If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.~)
(Daniel,3,18,But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.~)
(Daniel,3,19,Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.~)
(Daniel,3,20,And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.~)
(Daniel,3,21,Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.~)
(Daniel,3,22,Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.~)
(Daniel,3,23,And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.~)
(Daniel,3,24,Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.~)
(Daniel,3,25,He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.~)
(Daniel,3,26,Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.~)
(Daniel,3,27,And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.~)
(Daniel,3,28,Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.~)
(Daniel,3,29,Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.~)
(Daniel,3,30,Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.~)
(Daniel,4,1,Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.~)
(Daniel,4,2,I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.~)
(Daniel,4,3,How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.~)
(Daniel,4,4,I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace:~)
(Daniel,4,5,I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.~)
(Daniel,4,6,Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.~)
(Daniel,4,7,Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.~)
(Daniel,4,8,But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,~)
(Daniel,4,9,O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.~)
(Daniel,4,10,Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.~)
(Daniel,4,11,The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:~)
(Daniel,4,12,The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.~)
(Daniel,4,13,I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;~)
(Daniel,4,14,He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:~)
(Daniel,4,15,Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:~)
(Daniel,4,16,Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.~)
(Daniel,4,17,This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.~)
(Daniel,4,18,This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.~)
(Daniel,4,19,Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.~)
(Daniel,4,20,The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;~)
(Daniel,4,21,Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:~)
(Daniel,4,22,It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.~)
(Daniel,4,23,And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;~)
(Daniel,4,24,This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:~)
(Daniel,4,25,That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.~)
(Daniel,4,26,And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.~)
(Daniel,4,27,Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.~)
(Daniel,4,28,All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.~)
(Daniel,4,29,At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.~)
(Daniel,4,30,The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?~)
(Daniel,4,31,While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.~)
(Daniel,4,32,And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.~)
(Daniel,4,33,The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.~)
(Daniel,4,34,And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:~)
(Daniel,4,35,And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?~)
(Daniel,4,36,At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.~)
(Daniel,4,37,Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.~)
(Daniel,5,1,Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.~)
(Daniel,5,2,Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.~)
(Daniel,5,3,Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.~)
(Daniel,5,4,They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.~)
(Daniel,5,5,In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.~)
(Daniel,5,6,Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.~)
(Daniel,5,7,The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.~)
(Daniel,5,8,Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.~)
(Daniel,5,9,Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.~)
(Daniel,5,10,Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:~)
(Daniel,5,11,There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;~)
(Daniel,5,12,Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.~)
(Daniel,5,13,Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?~)
(Daniel,5,14,I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.~)
(Daniel,5,15,And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing:~)
(Daniel,5,16,And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.~)
(Daniel,5,17,Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.~)
(Daniel,5,18,O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:~)
(Daniel,5,19,And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.~)
(Daniel,5,20,But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:~)
(Daniel,5,21,And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.~)
(Daniel,5,22,And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;~)
(Daniel,5,23,But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:~)
(Daniel,5,24,Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written.~)
(Daniel,5,25,And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.~)
(Daniel,5,26,This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.~)
(Daniel,5,27,TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.~)
(Daniel,5,28,PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.~)
(Daniel,5,29,Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.~)
(Daniel,5,30,In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.~)
(Daniel,5,31,And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.~)
(Daniel,6,1,It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;~)
(Daniel,6,2,And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.~)
(Daniel,6,3,Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.~)
(Daniel,6,4,Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.~)
(Daniel,6,5,Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.~)
(Daniel,6,6,Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.~)
(Daniel,6,7,All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.~)
(Daniel,6,8,Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.~)
(Daniel,6,9,Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.~)
(Daniel,6,10,Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.~)
(Daniel,6,11,Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.~)
(Daniel,6,12,Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.~)
(Daniel,6,13,Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.~)
(Daniel,6,14,Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.~)
(Daniel,6,15,Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.~)
(Daniel,6,16,Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.~)
(Daniel,6,17,And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.~)
(Daniel,6,18,Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.~)
(Daniel,6,19,Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions.~)
(Daniel,6,20,And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?~)
(Daniel,6,21,Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.~)
(Daniel,6,22,My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.~)
(Daniel,6,23,Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.~)
(Daniel,6,24,And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.~)
(Daniel,6,25,Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.~)
(Daniel,6,26,I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.~)
(Daniel,6,27,He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.~)
(Daniel,6,28,So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.~)
(Daniel,7,1,In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.~)
(Daniel,7,2,Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.~)
(Daniel,7,3,And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.~)
(Daniel,7,4,The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.~)
(Daniel,7,5,And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.~)
(Daniel,7,6,After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.~)
(Daniel,7,7,After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.~)
(Daniel,7,8,I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.~)
(Daniel,7,9,I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.~)
(Daniel,7,10,A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.~)
(Daniel,7,11,I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.~)
(Daniel,7,12,As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.~)
(Daniel,7,13,I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.~)
(Daniel,7,14,And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.~)
(Daniel,7,15,I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.~)
(Daniel,7,16,I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.~)
(Daniel,7,17,These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.~)
(Daniel,7,18,But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.~)
(Daniel,7,19,Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;~)
(Daniel,7,20,And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.~)
(Daniel,7,21,I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;~)
(Daniel,7,22,Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.~)
(Daniel,7,23,Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.~)
(Daniel,7,24,And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.~)
(Daniel,7,25,And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.~)
(Daniel,7,26,But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.~)
(Daniel,7,27,And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.~)
(Daniel,7,28,Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.~)
(Daniel,8,1,In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.~)
(Daniel,8,2,And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.~)
(Daniel,8,3,Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.~)
(Daniel,8,4,I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.~)
(Daniel,8,5,And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.~)
(Daniel,8,6,And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.~)
(Daniel,8,7,And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.~)
(Daniel,8,8,Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.~)
(Daniel,8,9,And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.~)
(Daniel,8,10,And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.~)
(Daniel,8,11,Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.~)
(Daniel,8,12,And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.~)
(Daniel,8,13,Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?~)
(Daniel,8,14,And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.~)
(Daniel,8,15,And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.~)
(Daniel,8,16,And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.~)
(Daniel,8,17,So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.~)
(Daniel,8,18,Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.~)
(Daniel,8,19,And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.~)
(Daniel,8,20,The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.~)
(Daniel,8,21,And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.~)
(Daniel,8,22,Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.~)
(Daniel,8,23,And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.~)
(Daniel,8,24,And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.~)
(Daniel,8,25,And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.~)
(Daniel,8,26,And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.~)
(Daniel,8,27,And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.~)
(Daniel,9,1,In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;~)
(Daniel,9,2,In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.~)
(Daniel,9,3,And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:~)
(Daniel,9,4,And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;~)
(Daniel,9,5,We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:~)
(Daniel,9,6,Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.~)
(Daniel,9,7,O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.~)
(Daniel,9,8,O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.~)
(Daniel,9,9,To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against him;~)
(Daniel,9,10,Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets.~)
(Daniel,9,11,Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.~)
(Daniel,9,12,And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.~)
(Daniel,9,13,As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth.~)
(Daniel,9,14,Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.~)
(Daniel,9,15,And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.~)
(Daniel,9,16,O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.~)
(Daniel,9,17,Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.~)
(Daniel,9,18,O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.~)
(Daniel,9,19,O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.~)
(Daniel,9,20,And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;~)
(Daniel,9,21,Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.~)
(Daniel,9,22,And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.~)
(Daniel,9,23,At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.~)
(Daniel,9,24,Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.~)
(Daniel,9,25,Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.~)
(Daniel,9,26,And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.~)
(Daniel,9,27,And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.~)
(Daniel,10,1,In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.~)
(Daniel,10,2,In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.~)
(Daniel,10,3,I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.~)
(Daniel,10,4,And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;~)
(Daniel,10,5,Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:~)
(Daniel,10,6,His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.~)
(Daniel,10,7,And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves.~)
(Daniel,10,8,Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.~)
(Daniel,10,9,Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.~)
(Daniel,10,10,And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.~)
(Daniel,10,11,And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.~)
(Daniel,10,12,Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.~)
(Daniel,10,13,But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.~)
(Daniel,10,14,Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.~)
(Daniel,10,15,And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.~)
(Daniel,10,16,And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.~)
(Daniel,10,17,For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.~)
(Daniel,10,18,Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,~)
(Daniel,10,19,And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.~)
(Daniel,10,20,Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.~)
(Daniel,10,21,But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.~)
(Daniel,11,1,Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.~)
(Daniel,11,2,And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.~)
(Daniel,11,3,And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.~)
(Daniel,11,4,And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.~)
(Daniel,11,5,And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.~)
(Daniel,11,6,And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.~)
(Daniel,11,7,But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:~)
(Daniel,11,8,And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.~)

(Daniel,11,10,But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.~)
(Daniel,11,11,And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.~)
(Daniel,11,12,And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.~)

(Daniel,11,16,But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.~)
(Daniel,11,17,He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.~)
(Daniel,11,18,After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.~)
(Daniel,11,19,Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.~)
(Daniel,11,20,Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.~)

(Daniel,11,22,And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.~)
(Daniel,11,23,And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.~)
(Daniel,11,24,He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.~)
(Daniel,11,25,And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.~)
(Daniel,11,26,Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.~)
(Daniel,11,27,And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.~)

(Daniel,11,29,At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.~)
(Daniel,11,30,For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.~)
(Daniel,11,31,And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.~)
(Daniel,11,32,And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.~)
(Daniel,11,33,And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.~)
(Daniel,11,34,Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.~)
(Daniel,11,35,And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.~)
(Daniel,11,36,And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.~)
(Daniel,11,37,Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.~)
(Daniel,11,38,But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.~)
(Daniel,11,39,Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.~)
(Daniel,11,40,And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.~)
(Daniel,11,41,He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.~)
(Daniel,11,42,He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.~)
(Daniel,11,43,But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.~)
(Daniel,11,44,But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.~)
(Daniel,11,45,And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.~)
(Daniel,12,1,And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.~)

(Ruth,1,17,Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.~)
(Ruth,1,18,When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.~)
(Ruth,1,19,So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?~)
(Ruth,1,20,And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.~)
(Ruth,1,21,I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?~)
(Ruth,1,22,So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.~)
(Ruth,2,1,And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.~)
(Ruth,2,2,And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.~)
(Ruth,2,3,And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.~)
(Ruth,2,4,And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.~)
(Ruth,2,5,Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?~)
(Ruth,2,6,And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:~)
(Ruth,2,7,And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.~)
(Ruth,2,8,Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:~)
(Ruth,2,9,Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.~)
(Ruth,2,10,Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?~)
(Ruth,2,11,And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.~)
(Ruth,2,12,The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.~)
(Ruth,2,13,Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.~)
(Ruth,2,14,And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.~)
(Ruth,2,15,And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:~)
(Ruth,2,16,And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.~)
(Ruth,2,17,So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.~)
(Ruth,2,18,And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.~)
(Ruth,2,19,And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.~)
(Ruth,2,20,And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.~)
(Ruth,2,21,And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.~)
(Ruth,2,22,And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.~)
(Ruth,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.~)
(Ruth,3,1,Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?~)
(Ruth,3,2,And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.~)
(Ruth,3,3,Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.~)
(Ruth,3,4,And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.~)
(Ruth,3,5,And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.~)
(Ruth,3,6,And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.~)
(Ruth,3,7,And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.~)
(Ruth,3,8,And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.~)
(Ruth,3,9,And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.~)
(Ruth,3,10,And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.~)
(Ruth,3,11,And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.~)
(Ruth,3,12,And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.~)
(Ruth,3,13,Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.~)
(Ruth,3,14,And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.~)
(Ruth,3,15,Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.~)
(Ruth,3,16,And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.~)
(Ruth,3,17,And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.~)
(Ruth,3,18,Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.~)
(Ruth,4,1,Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.~)
(Ruth,4,2,And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.~)
(Ruth,4,3,And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:~)
(Ruth,4,4,And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.~)
(Ruth,4,5,Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.~)
(Ruth,4,6,And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.~)
(Ruth,4,7,Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel.~)
(Ruth,4,8,Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe.~)
(Ruth,4,9,And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.~)
(Ruth,4,10,Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.~)
(Ruth,4,11,And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:~)
(Ruth,4,12,And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.~)
(Ruth,4,13,So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.~)
(Ruth,4,14,And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.~)
(Ruth,4,15,And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.~)
(Ruth,4,16,And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.~)
(Ruth,4,17,And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.~)
(Ruth,4,18,Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,~)
(Ruth,4,19,And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,~)
(Ruth,4,20,And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,~)
(Ruth,4,21,And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,~)
(Ruth,4,22,And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.~)
(Jude,1,1,Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called:~)
(Jude,1,2,Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.~)
(Jude,1,3,Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.~)
(Jude,1,4,For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Jude,1,5,I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.~)
(Jude,1,6,And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.~)
(Jude,1,7,Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.~)
(Jude,1,8,Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.~)
(Jude,1,9,Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.~)
(Jude,1,10,But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.~)
(Jude,1,11,Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.~)
(Jude,1,12,These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;~)
(Jude,1,13,Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.~)

(Jude,1,16,These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage.~)
(Jude,1,17,But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;~)
(Jude,1,18,How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.~)
(Jude,1,19,These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.~)
(Jude,1,20,But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,~)
(Jude,1,21,Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.~)

(Habakkuk,1,1,The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.~)
(Habakkuk,1,2,O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!~)
(Habakkuk,1,3,Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.~)
(Habakkuk,1,4,Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.~)
(Habakkuk,1,5,Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you.~)
(Habakkuk,1,6,For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.~)
(Habakkuk,1,7,They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.~)
(Habakkuk,1,8,Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.~)
(Habakkuk,1,9,They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.~)
(Habakkuk,1,10,And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.~)
(Habakkuk,1,11,Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.~)
(Habakkuk,1,12,Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.~)
(Habakkuk,1,13,Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?~)
(Habakkuk,1,14,And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?~)
(Habakkuk,1,15,They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.~)
(Habakkuk,1,16,Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.~)
(Habakkuk,1,17,Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?~)
(Habakkuk,2,1,I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.~)
(Habakkuk,2,2,And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.~)
(Habakkuk,2,3,For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.~)
(Habakkuk,2,4,Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.~)

(Habakkuk,2,7,Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?~)
(Habakkuk,2,8,Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.~)
(Habakkuk,2,9,Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!~)
(Habakkuk,2,10,Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul.~)
(Habakkuk,2,11,For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.~)
(Habakkuk,2,12,Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!~)

(Habakkuk,3,7,I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.~)

(Habakkuk,3,9,Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.~)
(Habakkuk,3,10,The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.~)
(Habakkuk,3,11,The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.~)
(Habakkuk,3,12,Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.~)
(Habakkuk,3,13,Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.~)
(Habakkuk,3,14,Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.~)
(Habakkuk,3,15,Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters.~)
(Habakkuk,3,16,When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.~)
(Habakkuk,3,17,Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:~)

(Hebrews,2,18,For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.~)
(Hebrews,3,1,Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;~)
(Hebrews,3,2,Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.~)
(Hebrews,3,3,For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.~)
(Hebrews,3,4,For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.~)
(Hebrews,3,5,And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;~)
(Hebrews,3,6,But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.~)
(Hebrews,3,7,Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,~)
(Hebrews,3,8,Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:~)
(Hebrews,3,9,When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.~)
(Hebrews,3,10,Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.~)
(Hebrews,3,11,So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)~)
(Hebrews,3,12,Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.~)
(Hebrews,3,13,But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.~)
(Hebrews,3,14,For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;~)
(Hebrews,3,15,While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.~)
(Hebrews,3,16,For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.~)
(Hebrews,3,17,But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?~)
(Hebrews,3,18,And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?~)
(Hebrews,3,19,So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.~)
(Hebrews,4,1,Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.~)
(Hebrews,4,2,For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.~)
(Hebrews,4,3,For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.~)
(Hebrews,4,4,For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.~)
(Hebrews,4,5,And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.~)
(Hebrews,4,6,Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:~)
(Hebrews,4,7,Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.~)
(Hebrews,4,8,For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.~)
(Hebrews,4,9,There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.~)
(Hebrews,4,10,For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.~)
(Hebrews,4,11,Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.~)
(Hebrews,4,12,For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.~)
(Hebrews,4,13,Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.~)
(Hebrews,4,14,Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.~)
(Hebrews,4,15,For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.~)
(Hebrews,4,16,Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.~)
(Hebrews,5,1,For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:~)
(Hebrews,5,2,Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.~)
(Hebrews,5,3,And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.~)
(Hebrews,5,4,And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.~)
(Hebrews,5,5,So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.~)
(Hebrews,5,6,As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.~)
(Hebrews,5,7,Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;~)
(Hebrews,5,8,Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;~)
(Hebrews,5,9,And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;~)
(Hebrews,5,10,Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.~)
(Hebrews,5,11,Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.~)
(Hebrews,5,12,For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.~)
(Hebrews,5,13,For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.~)
(Hebrews,5,14,But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.~)
(Hebrews,6,1,Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,~)
(Hebrews,6,2,Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.~)
(Hebrews,6,3,And this will we do, if God permit.~)
(Hebrews,6,4,For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,~)
(Hebrews,6,5,And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,~)
(Hebrews,6,6,If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.~)
(Hebrews,6,7,For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:~)
(Hebrews,6,8,But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.~)
(Hebrews,6,9,But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.~)
(Hebrews,6,10,For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.~)
(Hebrews,6,11,And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:~)
(Hebrews,6,12,That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.~)
(Hebrews,6,13,For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,~)
(Hebrews,6,14,Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.~)
(Hebrews,6,15,And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.~)
(Hebrews,6,16,For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.~)
(Hebrews,6,17,Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:~)
(Hebrews,6,18,That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:~)
(Hebrews,6,19,Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;~)
(Hebrews,6,20,Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.~)
(Hebrews,7,1,For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;~)
(Hebrews,7,2,To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;~)
(Hebrews,7,3,Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.~)
(Hebrews,7,4,Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.~)
(Hebrews,7,5,And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:~)
(Hebrews,7,6,But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.~)
(Hebrews,7,7,And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.~)
(Hebrews,7,8,And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.~)
(Hebrews,7,9,And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.~)
(Hebrews,7,10,For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.~)
(Hebrews,7,11,If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?~)
(Hebrews,7,12,For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.~)
(Hebrews,7,13,For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.~)
(Hebrews,7,14,For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.~)
(Hebrews,7,15,And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,~)
(Hebrews,7,16,Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.~)
(Hebrews,7,17,For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.~)
(Hebrews,7,18,For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.~)
(Hebrews,7,19,For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.~)
(Hebrews,7,20,And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:~)
(Hebrews,7,21,(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)~)
(Hebrews,7,22,By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.~)
(Hebrews,7,23,And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:~)
(Hebrews,7,24,But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.~)
(Hebrews,7,25,Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.~)
(Hebrews,7,26,For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;~)
(Hebrews,7,27,Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.~)
(Hebrews,7,28,For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.~)
(Hebrews,8,1,Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;~)
(Hebrews,8,2,A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.~)
(Hebrews,8,3,For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.~)
(Hebrews,8,4,For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:~)
(Hebrews,8,5,Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.~)
(Hebrews,8,6,But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.~)
(Hebrews,8,7,For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.~)
(Hebrews,8,8,For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:~)
(Hebrews,8,9,Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.~)
(Hebrews,8,10,For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:~)
(Hebrews,8,11,And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.~)
(Hebrews,8,12,For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.~)
(Hebrews,8,13,In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.~)
(Hebrews,9,1,Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.~)
(Hebrews,9,2,For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.~)
(Hebrews,9,3,And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;~)
(Hebrews,9,4,Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;~)
(Hebrews,9,5,And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.~)
(Hebrews,9,6,Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.~)
(Hebrews,9,7,But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:~)
(Hebrews,9,8,The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:~)
(Hebrews,9,9,Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;~)
(Hebrews,9,10,Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.~)
(Hebrews,9,11,But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;~)
(Hebrews,9,12,Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.~)
(Hebrews,9,13,For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:~)
(Hebrews,9,14,How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?~)
(Hebrews,9,15,And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.~)
(Hebrews,9,16,For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.~)
(Hebrews,9,17,For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.~)
(Hebrews,9,18,Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.~)
(Hebrews,9,19,For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,~)
(Hebrews,9,20,Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.~)
(Hebrews,9,21,Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.~)
(Hebrews,9,22,And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.~)
(Hebrews,9,23,It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.~)
(Hebrews,9,24,For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:~)
(Hebrews,9,25,Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;~)
(Hebrews,9,26,For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.~)
(Hebrews,9,27,And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:~)
(Hebrews,9,28,So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.~)
(Hebrews,10,1,For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.~)
(Hebrews,10,2,For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.~)
(Hebrews,10,3,But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.~)
(Hebrews,10,4,For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.~)
(Hebrews,10,5,Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:~)
(Hebrews,10,6,In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.~)
(Hebrews,10,7,Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.~)
(Hebrews,10,8,Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;~)
(Hebrews,10,9,Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.~)
(Hebrews,10,10,By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.~)
(Hebrews,10,11,And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:~)
(Hebrews,10,12,But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;~)
(Hebrews,10,13,From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.~)
(Hebrews,10,14,For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.~)
(Hebrews,10,15,Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,~)
(Hebrews,10,16,This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;~)
(Hebrews,10,17,And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.~)
(Hebrews,10,18,Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.~)
(Hebrews,10,19,Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,~)
(Hebrews,10,20,By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;~)
(Hebrews,10,21,And having an high priest over the house of God;~)
(Hebrews,10,22,Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.~)
(Hebrews,10,23,Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)~)
(Hebrews,10,24,And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:~)
(Hebrews,10,25,Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.~)
(Hebrews,10,26,For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,~)
(Hebrews,10,27,But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.~)
(Hebrews,10,28,He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:~)
(Hebrews,10,29,Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?~)
(Hebrews,10,30,For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.~)
(Hebrews,10,31,It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.~)
(Hebrews,10,32,But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;~)
(Hebrews,10,33,Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.~)
(Hebrews,10,34,For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.~)
(Hebrews,10,35,Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.~)
(Hebrews,10,36,For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.~)
(Hebrews,10,37,For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.~)
(Hebrews,10,38,Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.~)
(Hebrews,10,39,But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.~)
(Hebrews,11,1,Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.~)
(Hebrews,11,2,For by it the elders obtained a good report.~)
(Hebrews,11,3,Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.~)
(Hebrews,11,4,By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.~)
(Hebrews,11,5,By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.~)
(Hebrews,11,6,But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.~)
(Hebrews,11,7,By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.~)
(Hebrews,11,8,By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.~)
(Hebrews,11,9,By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:~)
(Hebrews,11,10,For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.~)
(Hebrews,11,11,Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.~)
(Hebrews,11,12,Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.~)
(Hebrews,11,13,These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.~)
(Hebrews,11,14,For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.~)
(Hebrews,11,15,And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.~)
(Hebrews,11,16,But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.~)
(Hebrews,11,17,By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,~)
(Hebrews,11,18,Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:~)
(Hebrews,11,19,Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.~)
(Hebrews,11,20,By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.~)
(Hebrews,11,21,By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.~)
(Hebrews,11,22,By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.~)
(Hebrews,11,23,By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.~)
(Hebrews,11,24,By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;~)
(Hebrews,11,25,Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;~)
(Hebrews,11,26,Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.~)
(Hebrews,11,27,By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.~)
(Hebrews,11,28,Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.~)
(Hebrews,11,29,By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.~)
(Hebrews,11,30,By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.~)
(Hebrews,11,31,By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.~)
(Hebrews,11,32,And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:~)
(Hebrews,11,33,Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.~)
(Hebrews,11,34,Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.~)
(Hebrews,11,35,Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:~)
(Hebrews,11,36,And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:~)
(Hebrews,11,37,They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;~)
(Hebrews,11,38,(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.~)
(Hebrews,11,39,And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:~)
(Hebrews,11,40,God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.~)
(Hebrews,12,1,Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,~)
(Hebrews,12,2,Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.~)
(Hebrews,12,3,For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.~)
(Hebrews,12,4,Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.~)
(Hebrews,12,5,And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:~)
(Hebrews,12,6,For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.~)
(Hebrews,12,7,If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?~)
(Hebrews,12,8,But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.~)
(Hebrews,12,9,Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?~)
(Hebrews,12,10,For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.~)
(Hebrews,12,11,Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.~)
(Hebrews,12,12,Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;~)
(Hebrews,12,13,And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.~)
(Hebrews,12,14,Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:~)
(Hebrews,12,15,Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;~)
(Hebrews,12,16,Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.~)
(Hebrews,12,17,For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.~)
(Hebrews,12,18,For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,~)
(Hebrews,12,19,And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:~)
(Hebrews,12,20,(For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:~)
(Hebrews,12,21,And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)~)
(Hebrews,12,22,But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,~)
(Hebrews,12,23,To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,~)
(Hebrews,12,24,And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.~)
(Hebrews,12,25,See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:~)
(Hebrews,12,26,Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.~)
(Hebrews,12,27,And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.~)
(Hebrews,12,28,Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:~)
(Hebrews,12,29,For our God is a consuming fire.~)
(Hebrews,13,1,Let brotherly love continue.~)
(Hebrews,13,2,Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.~)
(Hebrews,13,3,Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.~)
(Hebrews,13,4,Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.~)
(Hebrews,13,5,Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.~)
(Hebrews,13,6,So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.~)
(Hebrews,13,7,Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.~)
(Hebrews,13,8,Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.~)
(Hebrews,13,9,Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.~)
(Hebrews,13,10,We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.~)
(Hebrews,13,11,For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.~)
(Hebrews,13,12,Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.~)
(Hebrews,13,13,Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.~)
(Hebrews,13,14,For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.~)
(Hebrews,13,15,By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.~)
(Hebrews,13,16,But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.~)
(Hebrews,13,17,Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.~)
(Hebrews,13,18,Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.~)
(Hebrews,13,19,But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.~)
(Hebrews,13,20,Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,~)
(Hebrews,13,21,Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.~)
(Hebrews,13,22,And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.~)
(Hebrews,13,23,Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.~)
(Hebrews,13,24,Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.~)
(Hebrews,13,25,Grace be with you all. Amen.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,1,Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,~)
(1 Corinthians,1,2,Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,3,Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,4,I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;~)
(1 Corinthians,1,5,That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;~)
(1 Corinthians,1,6,Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,7,So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,8,Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,9,God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,10,Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,11,For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,12,Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,13,Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?~)
(1 Corinthians,1,14,I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;~)
(1 Corinthians,1,15,Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,16,And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,17,For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,18,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,19,For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,20,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?~)
(1 Corinthians,1,21,For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,22,For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,23,But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;~)
(1 Corinthians,1,24,But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,25,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,26,For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,27,But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;~)
(1 Corinthians,1,28,And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,29,That no flesh should glory in his presence.~)
(1 Corinthians,1,30,But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:~)
(1 Corinthians,1,31,That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,1,And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,2,For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,3,And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,4,And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:~)
(1 Corinthians,2,5,That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,6,Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:~)
(1 Corinthians,2,7,But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:~)
(1 Corinthians,2,8,Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,9,But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,10,But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,11,For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,12,Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,13,Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,14,But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,15,But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.~)
(1 Corinthians,2,16,For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?  But we have the mind of Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,1,And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,2,I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,3,For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?~)
(1 Corinthians,3,4,For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?~)
(1 Corinthians,3,5,Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?~)
(1 Corinthians,3,6,I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,7,So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,8,Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,9,For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,10,According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,11,For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,12,Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;~)
(1 Corinthians,3,13,Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,14,If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,15,If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,16,Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?~)
(1 Corinthians,3,17,If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,18,Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,19,For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,20,And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.~)
(1 Corinthians,3,21,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;~)
(1 Corinthians,3,22,Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;~)
(1 Corinthians,3,23,And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,1,Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,2,Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,3,But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,5,Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,6,And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,7,For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?~)
(1 Corinthians,4,8,Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,9,For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,10,We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,11,Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;~)
(1 Corinthians,4,12,And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:~)
(1 Corinthians,4,13,Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,14,I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,15,For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,16,Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,17,For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,18,Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,19,But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,20,For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.~)
(1 Corinthians,4,21,What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?~)
(1 Corinthians,5,1,It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.~)
(1 Corinthians,5,2,And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.~)
(1 Corinthians,5,3,For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,~)
(1 Corinthians,5,4,In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,~)
(1 Corinthians,5,5,To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.~)
(1 Corinthians,5,6,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?~)
(1 Corinthians,5,7,Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:~)
(1 Corinthians,5,8,Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.~)
(1 Corinthians,5,9,I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:~)
(1 Corinthians,5,10,Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.~)
(1 Corinthians,5,11,But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.~)
(1 Corinthians,5,12,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?~)
(1 Corinthians,5,13,But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,1,Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?~)
(1 Corinthians,6,2,Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?~)
(1 Corinthians,6,3,Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?~)
(1 Corinthians,6,4,If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,5,I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?~)
(1 Corinthians,6,6,But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,7,Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?~)
(1 Corinthians,6,8,Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,9,Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,~)
(1 Corinthians,6,10,Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,11,And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,12,All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,13,Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,14,And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,15,Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,16,What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?  for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,17,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,18,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.~)
(1 Corinthians,6,19,What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?~)
(1 Corinthians,6,20,For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,2,Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,3,Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,4,The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,5,Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,6,But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,7,For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,8,I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,9,But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,10,And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:~)
(1 Corinthians,7,11,But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,12,But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,13,And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,14,For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,15,But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,16,For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?  or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?~)
(1 Corinthians,7,17,But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,18,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,19,Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,21,Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,22,For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,23,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,24,Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,25,Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,26,I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,28,But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,29,But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;~)
(1 Corinthians,7,30,And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;~)
(1 Corinthians,7,31,And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,32,But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:~)
(1 Corinthians,7,33,But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,34,There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,35,And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,36,But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,37,Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,38,So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,39,The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,7,40,But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,1,Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,2,And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,3,But if any man love God, the same is known of him.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,4,As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,5,For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)~)
(1 Corinthians,8,6,But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,7,Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,8,But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,10,For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;~)
(1 Corinthians,8,11,And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?~)
(1 Corinthians,8,12,But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,8,13,Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,2,If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,3,Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,~)
(1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eat and to drink?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,5,Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,6,Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,7,Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,8,Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,9,For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,10,Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,11,If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,12,If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather?  Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,13,Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?~)
(1 Corinthians,9,14,Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,15,But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,16,For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!~)
(1 Corinthians,9,17,For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,18,What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,19,For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,20,And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;~)
(1 Corinthians,9,21,To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,22,To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,23,And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,24,Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,25,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.~)
(1 Corinthians,9,26,I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:~)
(1 Corinthians,9,27,But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,1,Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;~)
(1 Corinthians,10,2,And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;~)
(1 Corinthians,10,3,And did all eat the same spiritual meat;~)
(1 Corinthians,10,4,And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,5,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,6,Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,7,Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,8,Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,9,Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,10,Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,11,Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,12,Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,13,There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,14,Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,15,I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,16,The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?~)
(1 Corinthians,10,17,For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?~)
(1 Corinthians,10,19,What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?~)
(1 Corinthians,10,20,But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,21,Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,22,Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?~)
(1 Corinthians,10,23,All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,24,Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,25,Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:~)
(1 Corinthians,10,26,For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,27,If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,28,But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:~)
(1 Corinthians,10,29,Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?~)
(1 Corinthians,10,30,For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?~)
(1 Corinthians,10,31,Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,10,32,Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:~)
(1 Corinthians,10,33,Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,1,Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,2,Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,3,But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,4,Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,5,But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,6,For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,7,For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,8,For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,9,Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,10,For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,11,Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,12,For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,13,Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?~)
(1 Corinthians,11,14,Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?~)
(1 Corinthians,11,15,But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,16,But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,17,Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,18,For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,19,For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,20,When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,21,For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,22,What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,23,For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:~)
(1 Corinthians,11,24,And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,25,After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,26,For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,27,Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,28,But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,29,For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,30,For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,31,For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,32,But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,33,Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.~)
(1 Corinthians,11,34,And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,1,Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,2,Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,3,Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,4,Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,5,And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,6,And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,8,For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;~)
(1 Corinthians,12,9,To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;~)
(1 Corinthians,12,10,To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:~)
(1 Corinthians,12,11,But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,12,For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,13,For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,14,For the body is not one member, but many.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,15,If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?~)
(1 Corinthians,12,16,And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?~)
(1 Corinthians,12,17,If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?~)
(1 Corinthians,12,18,But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,19,And if they were all one member, where were the body?~)
(1 Corinthians,12,20,But now are they many members, yet but one body.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,21,And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,22,Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:~)
(1 Corinthians,12,23,And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,24,For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,25,That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,26,And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,27,Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,28,And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.~)
(1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?~)
(1 Corinthians,12,30,Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?~)
(1 Corinthians,12,31,But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,1,Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,2,And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,3,And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,4,Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,~)
(1 Corinthians,13,5,Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;~)
(1 Corinthians,13,6,Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;~)
(1 Corinthians,13,7,Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,8,Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,9,For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,10,But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,11,When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,12,For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.~)
(1 Corinthians,13,13,And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,1,Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,2,For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,3,But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,5,I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,6,Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?~)
(1 Corinthians,14,7,And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?~)
(1 Corinthians,14,8,For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?~)
(1 Corinthians,14,9,So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,10,There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,11,Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,12,Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,13,Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,14,For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,15,What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,16,Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?~)
(1 Corinthians,14,17,For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,18,I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:~)
(1 Corinthians,14,19,Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,20,Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,21,In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the LORD.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,22,Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,23,If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?~)
(1 Corinthians,14,24,But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:~)
(1 Corinthians,14,25,And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,26,How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,27,If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,28,But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,29,Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,30,If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,31,For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,33,For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,34,Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,35,And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,36,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?~)
(1 Corinthians,14,37,If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,38,But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,39,Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.~)
(1 Corinthians,14,40,Let all things be done decently and in order.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,1,Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;~)
(1 Corinthians,15,2,By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,3,For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;~)
(1 Corinthians,15,4,And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,5,And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,6,After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,7,After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,8,And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,9,For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,10,But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,11,Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,12,Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?~)
(1 Corinthians,15,13,But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,14,And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,15,Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,16,For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,17,And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,19,If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,20,But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,21,For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,22,For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,23,But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,24,Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,25,For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,26,The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,27,For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,28,And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,29,Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?~)
(1 Corinthians,15,30,And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?~)
(1 Corinthians,15,31,I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,32,If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,33,Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,34,Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,35,But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?~)
(1 Corinthians,15,36,Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,37,And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,38,But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,39,All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,40,There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,41,There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,42,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,43,It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:~)
(1 Corinthians,15,44,It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,45,And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,46,Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,47,The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,48,As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,49,And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,50,Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,51,Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,~)
(1 Corinthians,15,52,In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,53,For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,54,So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,55,O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?~)
(1 Corinthians,15,56,The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,57,But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(1 Corinthians,15,58,Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,1,Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,2,Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,3,And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,4,And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,5,Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,6,And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,7,For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,8,But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,9,For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,10,Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,11,Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,12,As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,13,Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,14,Let all your things be done with charity.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,15,I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)~)
(1 Corinthians,16,16,That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,17,I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,18,For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,19,The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,21,The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,22,If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.~)
(1 Corinthians,16,24,My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.~)
(1 Samuel,1,1,Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:~)
(1 Samuel,1,2,And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.~)
(1 Samuel,1,3,And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.~)
(1 Samuel,1,4,And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:~)
(1 Samuel,1,5,But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.~)
(1 Samuel,1,6,And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.~)
(1 Samuel,1,7,And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.~)
(1 Samuel,1,8,Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?~)
(1 Samuel,1,9,So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,1,10,And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.~)
(1 Samuel,1,11,And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.~)
(1 Samuel,1,12,And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.~)
(1 Samuel,1,13,Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.~)
(1 Samuel,1,14,And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.~)
(1 Samuel,1,15,And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,1,16,Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.~)
(1 Samuel,1,17,Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.~)
(1 Samuel,1,18,And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.~)
(1 Samuel,1,19,And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.~)
(1 Samuel,1,20,Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,1,21,And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.~)
(1 Samuel,1,22,But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,1,23,And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.~)
(1 Samuel,1,24,And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.~)
(1 Samuel,1,25,And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.~)
(1 Samuel,1,26,And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:~)
(1 Samuel,1,28,Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.~)
(1 Samuel,2,1,And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.~)
(1 Samuel,2,2,There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.~)
(1 Samuel,2,3,Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.~)
(1 Samuel,2,4,The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.~)
(1 Samuel,2,5,They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.~)
(1 Samuel,2,6,The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.~)
(1 Samuel,2,7,The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.~)
(1 Samuel,2,8,He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.~)
(1 Samuel,2,9,He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.~)
(1 Samuel,2,10,The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.~)
(1 Samuel,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.~)
(1 Samuel,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,2,13,And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;~)
(1 Samuel,2,14,And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.~)
(1 Samuel,2,15,Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.~)
(1 Samuel,2,16,And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.~)
(1 Samuel,2,17,Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,2,18,But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.~)
(1 Samuel,2,19,Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.~)
(1 Samuel,2,20,And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.~)
(1 Samuel,2,21,And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,2,22,Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.~)
(1 Samuel,2,23,And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.~)
(1 Samuel,2,24,Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgress.~)
(1 Samuel,2,25,If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.~)
(1 Samuel,2,26,And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.~)
(1 Samuel,2,27,And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?~)
(1 Samuel,2,28,And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?~)
(1 Samuel,2,29,Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?~)
(1 Samuel,2,30,Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.~)
(1 Samuel,2,31,Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.~)
(1 Samuel,2,32,And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,2,33,And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.~)
(1 Samuel,2,34,And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.~)
(1 Samuel,2,35,And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,2,36,And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.~)
(1 Samuel,3,1,And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.~)
(1 Samuel,3,2,And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;~)
(1 Samuel,3,3,And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;~)
(1 Samuel,3,4,That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.~)
(1 Samuel,3,5,And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.~)
(1 Samuel,3,6,And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.~)
(1 Samuel,3,7,Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.~)
(1 Samuel,3,8,And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.~)
(1 Samuel,3,9,Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.~)
(1 Samuel,3,10,And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.~)
(1 Samuel,3,11,And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.~)
(1 Samuel,3,12,In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.~)
(1 Samuel,3,13,For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.~)
(1 Samuel,3,14,And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,3,15,And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.~)
(1 Samuel,3,16,Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.~)
(1 Samuel,3,17,And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.~)
(1 Samuel,3,18,And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.~)
(1 Samuel,3,19,And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.~)
(1 Samuel,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,4,1,And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.~)
(1 Samuel,4,2,And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.~)
(1 Samuel,4,3,And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.~)
(1 Samuel,4,4,So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.~)
(1 Samuel,4,5,And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.~)
(1 Samuel,4,6,And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.~)
(1 Samuel,4,7,And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.~)
(1 Samuel,4,8,Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.~)
(1 Samuel,4,9,Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.~)
(1 Samuel,4,10,And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.~)
(1 Samuel,4,11,And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.~)
(1 Samuel,4,12,And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.~)
(1 Samuel,4,13,And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.~)
(1 Samuel,4,14,And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.~)
(1 Samuel,4,15,Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.~)
(1 Samuel,4,16,And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?~)
(1 Samuel,4,17,And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.~)
(1 Samuel,4,18,And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.~)
(1 Samuel,4,19,And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.~)
(1 Samuel,4,20,And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it.~)
(1 Samuel,4,21,And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.~)
(1 Samuel,4,22,And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken.~)
(1 Samuel,5,1,And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.~)
(1 Samuel,5,2,When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.~)
(1 Samuel,5,3,And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.~)
(1 Samuel,5,4,And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.~)
(1 Samuel,5,5,Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.~)
(1 Samuel,5,6,But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.~)
(1 Samuel,5,7,And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.~)
(1 Samuel,5,8,They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.~)
(1 Samuel,5,9,And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.~)
(1 Samuel,5,10,Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.~)
(1 Samuel,5,11,So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.~)
(1 Samuel,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.~)
(1 Samuel,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.~)
(1 Samuel,6,2,And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.~)
(1 Samuel,6,3,And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.~)
(1 Samuel,6,4,Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.~)
(1 Samuel,6,5,Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.~)
(1 Samuel,6,6,Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?~)
(1 Samuel,6,7,Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:~)
(1 Samuel,6,8,And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.~)
(1 Samuel,6,9,And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to us.~)
(1 Samuel,6,10,And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:~)
(1 Samuel,6,11,And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.~)
(1 Samuel,6,12,And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.~)
(1 Samuel,6,13,And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.~)
(1 Samuel,6,14,And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,6,15,And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,6,16,And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.~)
(1 Samuel,6,17,And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;~)
(1 Samuel,6,18,And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.~)
(1 Samuel,6,19,And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.~)
(1 Samuel,6,20,And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?~)
(1 Samuel,6,21,And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.~)
(1 Samuel,7,1,And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,7,2,And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,7,3,And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,7,4,Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.~)
(1 Samuel,7,5,And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,7,6,And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.~)
(1 Samuel,7,7,And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,7,8,And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,7,9,And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.~)
(1 Samuel,7,10,And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,7,11,And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.~)
(1 Samuel,7,12,Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.~)
(1 Samuel,7,13,So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.~)
(1 Samuel,7,14,And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.~)
(1 Samuel,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.~)
(1 Samuel,7,16,And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.~)
(1 Samuel,7,17,And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,8,1,And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,8,2,Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.~)
(1 Samuel,8,3,And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.~)
(1 Samuel,8,4,Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,~)
(1 Samuel,8,5,And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.~)
(1 Samuel,8,6,But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,8,7,And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.~)
(1 Samuel,8,8,According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.~)
(1 Samuel,8,9,Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.~)
(1 Samuel,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.~)
(1 Samuel,8,11,And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.~)
(1 Samuel,8,12,And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.~)
(1 Samuel,8,13,And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.~)
(1 Samuel,8,14,And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.~)
(1 Samuel,8,15,And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.~)
(1 Samuel,8,16,And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.~)
(1 Samuel,8,17,He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.~)
(1 Samuel,8,18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.~)
(1 Samuel,8,19,Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;~)
(1 Samuel,8,20,That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.~)
(1 Samuel,8,21,And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,8,22,And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.~)
(1 Samuel,9,1,Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.~)
(1 Samuel,9,2,And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.~)
(1 Samuel,9,3,And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.~)
(1 Samuel,9,4,And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.~)
(1 Samuel,9,5,And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.~)
(1 Samuel,9,6,And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.~)
(1 Samuel,9,7,Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?~)
(1 Samuel,9,8,And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.~)
(1 Samuel,9,9,(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)~)
(1 Samuel,9,10,Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.~)
(1 Samuel,9,11,And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?~)
(1 Samuel,9,12,And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:~)
(1 Samuel,9,13,As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.~)
(1 Samuel,9,14,And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.~)
(1 Samuel,9,15,Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,~)
(1 Samuel,9,16,To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.~)
(1 Samuel,9,17,And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.~)
(1 Samuel,9,18,Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is.~)
(1 Samuel,9,19,And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.~)
(1 Samuel,9,20,And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?~)
(1 Samuel,9,21,And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?~)
(1 Samuel,9,22,And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.~)
(1 Samuel,9,23,And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.~)
(1 Samuel,9,24,And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.~)
(1 Samuel,9,25,And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.~)
(1 Samuel,9,26,And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.~)
(1 Samuel,9,27,And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.~)
(1 Samuel,10,1,Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?~)
(1 Samuel,10,2,When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?~)
(1 Samuel,10,3,Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:~)
(1 Samuel,10,4,And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.~)
(1 Samuel,10,5,After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:~)
(1 Samuel,10,6,And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.~)
(1 Samuel,10,7,And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.~)
(1 Samuel,10,8,And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.~)
(1 Samuel,10,9,And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.~)
(1 Samuel,10,10,And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.~)
(1 Samuel,10,11,And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?~)
(1 Samuel,10,12,And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?~)
(1 Samuel,10,13,And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.~)
(1 Samuel,10,14,And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?  And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.~)
(1 Samuel,10,15,And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.~)
(1 Samuel,10,16,And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.~)
(1 Samuel,10,17,And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;~)
(1 Samuel,10,18,And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:~)
(1 Samuel,10,19,And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.~)
(1 Samuel,10,20,And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.~)
(1 Samuel,10,21,When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.~)
(1 Samuel,10,22,Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stuff.~)
(1 Samuel,10,23,And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.~)
(1 Samuel,10,24,And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.~)
(1 Samuel,10,25,Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.~)
(1 Samuel,10,26,And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.~)
(1 Samuel,10,27,But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.~)
(1 Samuel,11,1,Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.~)
(1 Samuel,11,2,And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,11,3,And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.~)
(1 Samuel,11,4,Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept.~)
(1 Samuel,11,5,And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.~)
(1 Samuel,11,6,And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.~)
(1 Samuel,11,7,And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.~)
(1 Samuel,11,8,And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.~)
(1 Samuel,11,9,And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.~)
(1 Samuel,11,10,Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.~)
(1 Samuel,11,11,And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.~)
(1 Samuel,11,12,And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.~)
(1 Samuel,11,13,And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,11,14,Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.~)
(1 Samuel,11,15,And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.~)
(1 Samuel,12,1,And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.~)
(1 Samuel,12,2,And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.~)
(1 Samuel,12,3,Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.~)
(1 Samuel,12,4,And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.~)
(1 Samuel,12,5,And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.~)
(1 Samuel,12,6,And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.~)
(1 Samuel,12,7,Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.~)
(1 Samuel,12,8,When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.~)
(1 Samuel,12,9,And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.~)
(1 Samuel,12,10,And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.~)
(1 Samuel,12,11,And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe.~)
(1 Samuel,12,12,And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.~)
(1 Samuel,12,13,Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.~)
(1 Samuel,12,14,If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:~)
(1 Samuel,12,15,But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.~)
(1 Samuel,12,16,Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.~)
(1 Samuel,12,17,Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.~)
(1 Samuel,12,18,So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.~)
(1 Samuel,12,19,And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.~)
(1 Samuel,12,20,And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;~)
(1 Samuel,12,21,And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.~)
(1 Samuel,12,22,For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.~)
(1 Samuel,12,23,Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:~)
(1 Samuel,12,24,Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.~)
(1 Samuel,12,25,But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.~)
(1 Samuel,13,1,Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,~)
(1 Samuel,13,2,Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.~)
(1 Samuel,13,3,And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.~)
(1 Samuel,13,4,And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.~)
(1 Samuel,13,5,And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.~)
(1 Samuel,13,6,When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.~)
(1 Samuel,13,7,And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.~)
(1 Samuel,13,8,And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.~)
(1 Samuel,13,9,And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.~)
(1 Samuel,13,10,And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.~)
(1 Samuel,13,11,And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;~)
(1 Samuel,13,12,Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.~)
(1 Samuel,13,13,And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,13,14,But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.~)
(1 Samuel,13,15,And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.~)
(1 Samuel,13,16,And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.~)
(1 Samuel,13,17,And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:~)
(1 Samuel,13,18,And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.~)
(1 Samuel,13,19,Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:~)
(1 Samuel,13,20,But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.~)
(1 Samuel,13,21,Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.~)
(1 Samuel,13,22,So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.~)
(1 Samuel,13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.~)
(1 Samuel,14,1,Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.~)
(1 Samuel,14,2,And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;~)
(1 Samuel,14,3,And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.~)
(1 Samuel,14,4,And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.~)
(1 Samuel,14,5,The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.~)
(1 Samuel,14,6,And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.~)
(1 Samuel,14,7,And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.~)
(1 Samuel,14,8,Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.~)
(1 Samuel,14,9,If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.~)
(1 Samuel,14,10,But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.~)
(1 Samuel,14,11,And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.~)
(1 Samuel,14,12,And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,14,13,And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.~)
(1 Samuel,14,14,And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.~)
(1 Samuel,14,15,And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.~)
(1 Samuel,14,16,And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.~)
(1 Samuel,14,17,Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.~)
(1 Samuel,14,18,And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,14,19,And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.~)
(1 Samuel,14,20,And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.~)
(1 Samuel,14,21,Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.~)
(1 Samuel,14,22,Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.~)
(1 Samuel,14,23,So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.~)
(1 Samuel,14,24,And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.~)
(1 Samuel,14,25,And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.~)
(1 Samuel,14,26,And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.~)
(1 Samuel,14,27,But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.~)
(1 Samuel,14,28,Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.~)
(1 Samuel,14,29,Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.~)
(1 Samuel,14,30,How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?~)
(1 Samuel,14,31,And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.~)
(1 Samuel,14,32,And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.~)
(1 Samuel,14,33,Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.~)
(1 Samuel,14,34,And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.~)
(1 Samuel,14,35,And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,14,36,And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.~)
(1 Samuel,14,37,And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.~)
(1 Samuel,14,38,And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.~)
(1 Samuel,14,39,For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.~)
(1 Samuel,14,40,Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.~)
(1 Samuel,14,41,Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.~)
(1 Samuel,14,42,And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.~)
(1 Samuel,14,43,Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.~)
(1 Samuel,14,44,And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.~)
(1 Samuel,14,45,And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.~)
(1 Samuel,14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.~)
(1 Samuel,14,47,So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.~)
(1 Samuel,14,48,And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.~)
(1 Samuel,14,49,Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:~)
(1 Samuel,14,50,And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.~)
(1 Samuel,14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.~)
(1 Samuel,14,52,And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.~)
(1 Samuel,15,1,Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,15,2,Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.~)
(1 Samuel,15,3,Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.~)
(1 Samuel,15,4,And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.~)
(1 Samuel,15,5,And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.~)
(1 Samuel,15,6,And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.~)
(1 Samuel,15,7,And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.~)
(1 Samuel,15,8,And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.~)
(1 Samuel,15,9,But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.~)
(1 Samuel,15,10,Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,~)
(1 Samuel,15,11,It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.~)
(1 Samuel,15,12,And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.~)
(1 Samuel,15,13,And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,15,14,And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?~)
(1 Samuel,15,15,And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.~)
(1 Samuel,15,16,Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.~)
(1 Samuel,15,17,And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?~)
(1 Samuel,15,18,And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.~)
(1 Samuel,15,19,Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?~)
(1 Samuel,15,20,And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.~)
(1 Samuel,15,21,But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.~)
(1 Samuel,15,22,And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.~)
(1 Samuel,15,23,For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.~)
(1 Samuel,15,24,And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.~)
(1 Samuel,15,25,Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,15,26,And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,15,27,And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.~)
(1 Samuel,15,28,And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.~)
(1 Samuel,15,29,And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.~)
(1 Samuel,15,30,Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.~)
(1 Samuel,15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,15,32,Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.~)
(1 Samuel,15,33,And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.~)
(1 Samuel,15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,16,1,And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.~)
(1 Samuel,16,2,And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,16,3,And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.~)
(1 Samuel,16,4,And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?~)
(1 Samuel,16,5,And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.~)
(1 Samuel,16,6,And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.~)
(1 Samuel,16,7,But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.~)
(1 Samuel,16,8,Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.~)
(1 Samuel,16,9,Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.~)
(1 Samuel,16,10,Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.~)
(1 Samuel,16,11,And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.~)
(1 Samuel,16,12,And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.~)
(1 Samuel,16,13,Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.~)
(1 Samuel,16,14,But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.~)
(1 Samuel,16,15,And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.~)
(1 Samuel,16,16,Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.~)
(1 Samuel,16,17,And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.~)
(1 Samuel,16,18,Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.~)
(1 Samuel,16,19,Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.~)
(1 Samuel,16,20,And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,16,21,And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.~)
(1 Samuel,16,22,And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.~)
(1 Samuel,16,23,And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,1,Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.~)
(1 Samuel,17,2,And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,17,3,And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.~)
(1 Samuel,17,4,And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.~)
(1 Samuel,17,5,And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.~)
(1 Samuel,17,6,And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.~)
(1 Samuel,17,7,And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,8,And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.~)
(1 Samuel,17,9,If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.~)
(1 Samuel,17,10,And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.~)
(1 Samuel,17,11,When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.~)
(1 Samuel,17,12,Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,17,13,And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.~)
(1 Samuel,17,14,And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,17,15,But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.~)
(1 Samuel,17,16,And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.~)
(1 Samuel,17,17,And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren;~)
(1 Samuel,17,18,And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.~)
(1 Samuel,17,19,Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,17,20,And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.~)
(1 Samuel,17,21,For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.~)
(1 Samuel,17,22,And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.~)
(1 Samuel,17,23,And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.~)
(1 Samuel,17,24,And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.~)
(1 Samuel,17,25,And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,17,26,And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?~)
(1 Samuel,17,27,And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,28,And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.~)
(1 Samuel,17,29,And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?~)
(1 Samuel,17,30,And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.~)
(1 Samuel,17,31,And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,32,And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.~)
(1 Samuel,17,33,And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.~)
(1 Samuel,17,34,And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:~)
(1 Samuel,17,35,And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,36,Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.~)
(1 Samuel,17,37,David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.~)
(1 Samuel,17,38,And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.~)
(1 Samuel,17,39,And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,40,And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.~)
(1 Samuel,17,41,And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.~)
(1 Samuel,17,42,And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.~)
(1 Samuel,17,43,And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.~)
(1 Samuel,17,44,And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.~)
(1 Samuel,17,45,Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.~)
(1 Samuel,17,46,This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.~)
(1 Samuel,17,47,And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.~)
(1 Samuel,17,48,And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.~)
(1 Samuel,17,49,And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.~)
(1 Samuel,17,50,So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.~)
(1 Samuel,17,51,Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.~)
(1 Samuel,17,52,And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.~)
(1 Samuel,17,53,And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.~)
(1 Samuel,17,54,And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.~)
(1 Samuel,17,55,And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.~)
(1 Samuel,17,56,And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.~)
(1 Samuel,17,57,And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.~)
(1 Samuel,17,58,And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.~)
(1 Samuel,18,1,And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.~)
(1 Samuel,18,2,And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.~)
(1 Samuel,18,3,Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.~)
(1 Samuel,18,4,And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.~)
(1 Samuel,18,5,And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.~)
(1 Samuel,18,6,And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.~)
(1 Samuel,18,7,And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.~)
(1 Samuel,18,8,And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?~)
(1 Samuel,18,9,And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.~)
(1 Samuel,18,10,And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand.~)
(1 Samuel,18,11,And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.~)
(1 Samuel,18,12,And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,18,13,Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.~)
(1 Samuel,18,14,And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.~)
(1 Samuel,18,15,Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.~)
(1 Samuel,18,16,But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.~)
(1 Samuel,18,17,And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.~)
(1 Samuel,18,18,And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?~)
(1 Samuel,18,19,But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.~)
(1 Samuel,18,20,And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.~)
(1 Samuel,18,21,And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.~)
(1 Samuel,18,22,And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.~)
(1 Samuel,18,23,And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?~)
(1 Samuel,18,24,And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.~)
(1 Samuel,18,25,And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,18,26,And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.~)
(1 Samuel,18,27,Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.~)
(1 Samuel,18,28,And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him.~)
(1 Samuel,18,29,And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually.~)
(1 Samuel,18,30,Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.~)
(1 Samuel,19,1,And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David.~)
(1 Samuel,19,2,But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:~)
(1 Samuel,19,3,And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee.~)
(1 Samuel,19,4,And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to thee-ward very good:~)
(1 Samuel,19,5,For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?~)
(1 Samuel,19,6,And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.~)
(1 Samuel,19,7,And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past.~)
(1 Samuel,19,8,And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him.~)
(1 Samuel,19,9,And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.~)
(1 Samuel,19,10,And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.~)
(1 Samuel,19,11,Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.~)
(1 Samuel,19,12,So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped.~)
(1 Samuel,19,13,And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.~)
(1 Samuel,19,14,And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.~)
(1 Samuel,19,15,And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.~)
(1 Samuel,19,16,And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.~)
(1 Samuel,19,17,And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?~)
(1 Samuel,19,18,So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.~)
(1 Samuel,19,19,And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.~)
(1 Samuel,19,20,And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.~)
(1 Samuel,19,21,And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.~)
(1 Samuel,19,22,Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.~)
(1 Samuel,19,23,And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.~)
(1 Samuel,19,24,And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?~)
(1 Samuel,20,1,And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?~)
(1 Samuel,20,2,And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.~)
(1 Samuel,20,3,And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.~)
(1 Samuel,20,4,Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.~)
(1 Samuel,20,5,And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.~)
(1 Samuel,20,6,If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.~)
(1 Samuel,20,7,If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.~)
(1 Samuel,20,8,Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?~)
(1 Samuel,20,9,And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?~)
(1 Samuel,20,10,Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy father answer thee roughly?~)
(1 Samuel,20,11,And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.~)
(1 Samuel,20,12,And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;~)
(1 Samuel,20,13,The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.~)
(1 Samuel,20,14,And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:~)
(1 Samuel,20,15,But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.~)
(1 Samuel,20,16,So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.~)
(1 Samuel,20,17,And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.~)
(1 Samuel,20,18,Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.~)
(1 Samuel,20,19,And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.~)
(1 Samuel,20,20,And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.~)
(1 Samuel,20,21,And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.~)
(1 Samuel,20,22,But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.~)
(1 Samuel,20,23,And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,20,24,So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.~)
(1 Samuel,20,25,And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.~)
(1 Samuel,20,26,Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.~)
(1 Samuel,20,27,And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?~)
(1 Samuel,20,28,And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:~)
(1 Samuel,20,29,And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.~)
(1 Samuel,20,30,Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?~)
(1 Samuel,20,31,For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.~)
(1 Samuel,20,32,And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?~)
(1 Samuel,20,33,And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.~)
(1 Samuel,20,34,So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.~)
(1 Samuel,20,35,And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.~)
(1 Samuel,20,36,And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.~)
(1 Samuel,20,37,And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?~)
(1 Samuel,20,38,And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.~)
(1 Samuel,20,39,But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.~)
(1 Samuel,20,40,And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.~)
(1 Samuel,20,41,And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.~)
(1 Samuel,20,42,And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.~)
(1 Samuel,21,1,Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?~)
(1 Samuel,21,2,And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a place.~)
(1 Samuel,21,3,Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present.~)
(1 Samuel,21,4,And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.~)
(1 Samuel,21,5,And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.~)
(1 Samuel,21,6,So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.~)
(1 Samuel,21,7,Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,21,8,And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste.~)
(1 Samuel,21,9,And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.~)
(1 Samuel,21,10,And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.~)
(1 Samuel,21,11,And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?~)
(1 Samuel,21,12,And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.~)
(1 Samuel,21,13,And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.~)
(1 Samuel,21,14,Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?~)
(1 Samuel,21,15,Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?~)
(1 Samuel,22,1,David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him.~)
(1 Samuel,22,2,And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.~)
(1 Samuel,22,3,And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.~)
(1 Samuel,22,4,And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.~)
(1 Samuel,22,5,And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.~)
(1 Samuel,22,6,When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)~)
(1 Samuel,22,7,Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;~)
(1 Samuel,22,8,That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?~)
(1 Samuel,22,9,Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.~)
(1 Samuel,22,10,And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.~)
(1 Samuel,22,11,Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.~)
(1 Samuel,22,12,And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.~)
(1 Samuel,22,13,And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?~)
(1 Samuel,22,14,Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?~)
(1 Samuel,22,15,Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.~)
(1 Samuel,22,16,And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.~)
(1 Samuel,22,17,And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,22,18,And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.~)
(1 Samuel,22,19,And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.~)
(1 Samuel,22,20,And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.~)
(1 Samuel,22,21,And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests.~)
(1 Samuel,22,22,And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.~)
(1 Samuel,22,23,Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.~)
(1 Samuel,23,1,Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.~)
(1 Samuel,23,2,Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.~)
(1 Samuel,23,3,And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?~)
(1 Samuel,23,4,Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand.~)
(1 Samuel,23,5,So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.~)
(1 Samuel,23,6,And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.~)
(1 Samuel,23,7,And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.~)
(1 Samuel,23,8,And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.~)
(1 Samuel,23,9,And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.~)
(1 Samuel,23,10,Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake.~)
(1 Samuel,23,11,Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down.~)
(1 Samuel,23,12,Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver thee up.~)
(1 Samuel,23,13,Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.~)
(1 Samuel,23,14,And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.~)
(1 Samuel,23,15,And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.~)
(1 Samuel,23,16,And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.~)
(1 Samuel,23,17,And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.~)
(1 Samuel,23,18,And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.~)
(1 Samuel,23,19,Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?~)
(1 Samuel,23,20,Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hand.~)
(1 Samuel,23,21,And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me.~)
(1 Samuel,23,22,Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.~)
(1 Samuel,23,23,See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.~)
(1 Samuel,23,24,And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.~)
(1 Samuel,23,25,Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.~)
(1 Samuel,23,26,And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.~)
(1 Samuel,23,27,But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.~)
(1 Samuel,23,28,Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.~)
(1 Samuel,23,29,And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.~)
(1 Samuel,24,1,And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.~)
(1 Samuel,24,2,Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.~)
(1 Samuel,24,3,And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.~)
(1 Samuel,24,4,And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.~)
(1 Samuel,24,5,And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.~)
(1 Samuel,24,6,And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.~)
(1 Samuel,24,7,So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.~)
(1 Samuel,24,8,David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.~)
(1 Samuel,24,9,And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?~)
(1 Samuel,24,10,Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.~)
(1 Samuel,24,11,Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.~)
(1 Samuel,24,12,The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.~)
(1 Samuel,24,13,As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.~)
(1 Samuel,24,14,After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.~)
(1 Samuel,24,15,The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.~)
(1 Samuel,24,16,And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.~)
(1 Samuel,24,17,And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.~)
(1 Samuel,24,18,And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.~)
(1 Samuel,24,19,For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.~)
(1 Samuel,24,20,And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.~)
(1 Samuel,24,21,Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.~)
(1 Samuel,24,22,And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.~)
(1 Samuel,25,1,And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.~)
(1 Samuel,25,2,And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.~)
(1 Samuel,25,3,Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.~)
(1 Samuel,25,4,And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.~)
(1 Samuel,25,5,And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:~)
(1 Samuel,25,6,And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.~)
(1 Samuel,25,7,And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.~)
(1 Samuel,25,8,Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.~)
(1 Samuel,25,9,And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.~)
(1 Samuel,25,10,And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.~)
(1 Samuel,25,11,Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?~)
(1 Samuel,25,12,So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.~)
(1 Samuel,25,13,And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.~)
(1 Samuel,25,14,But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.~)
(1 Samuel,25,15,But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:~)
(1 Samuel,25,16,They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.~)
(1 Samuel,25,17,Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.~)
(1 Samuel,25,18,Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.~)
(1 Samuel,25,19,And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.~)
(1 Samuel,25,20,And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.~)
(1 Samuel,25,21,Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.~)
(1 Samuel,25,22,So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.~)
(1 Samuel,25,23,And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,~)
(1 Samuel,25,24,And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.~)
(1 Samuel,25,25,Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.~)
(1 Samuel,25,26,Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.~)
(1 Samuel,25,27,And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.~)
(1 Samuel,25,28,I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.~)
(1 Samuel,25,29,Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.~)
(1 Samuel,25,30,And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;~)
(1 Samuel,25,31,That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.~)
(1 Samuel,25,32,And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:~)
(1 Samuel,25,33,And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.~)
(1 Samuel,25,34,For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.~)
(1 Samuel,25,35,So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.~)
(1 Samuel,25,36,And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.~)
(1 Samuel,25,37,But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.~)
(1 Samuel,25,38,And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.~)
(1 Samuel,25,39,And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.~)
(1 Samuel,25,40,And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife.~)
(1 Samuel,25,41,And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.~)
(1 Samuel,25,42,And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.~)
(1 Samuel,25,43,David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.~)
(1 Samuel,25,44,But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.~)
(1 Samuel,26,1,And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?~)
(1 Samuel,26,2,Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.~)
(1 Samuel,26,3,And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.~)
(1 Samuel,26,4,David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.~)
(1 Samuel,26,5,And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.~)
(1 Samuel,26,6,Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.~)
(1 Samuel,26,7,So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.~)
(1 Samuel,26,8,Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.~)
(1 Samuel,26,9,And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltless?~)
(1 Samuel,26,10,David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.~)
(1 Samuel,26,11,The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.~)
(1 Samuel,26,12,So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.~)
(1 Samuel,26,13,Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:~)
(1 Samuel,26,14,And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?~)
(1 Samuel,26,15,And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.~)
(1 Samuel,26,16,This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.~)
(1 Samuel,26,17,And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.~)
(1 Samuel,26,18,And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?  for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?~)
(1 Samuel,26,19,Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.~)
(1 Samuel,26,20,Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.~)
(1 Samuel,26,21,Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.~)
(1 Samuel,26,22,And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.~)
(1 Samuel,26,23,The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed.~)
(1 Samuel,26,24,And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.~)
(1 Samuel,26,25,Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.~)
(1 Samuel,27,1,And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.~)
(1 Samuel,27,2,And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.~)
(1 Samuel,27,3,And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.~)
(1 Samuel,27,4,And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him.~)
(1 Samuel,27,5,And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?~)
(1 Samuel,27,6,Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.~)
(1 Samuel,27,7,And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months.~)
(1 Samuel,27,8,And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.~)
(1 Samuel,27,9,And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.~)
(1 Samuel,27,10,And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.~)
(1 Samuel,27,11,And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,27,12,And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,28,1,And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.~)
(1 Samuel,28,2,And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever.~)
(1 Samuel,28,3,Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.~)
(1 Samuel,28,4,And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.~)
(1 Samuel,28,5,And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.~)
(1 Samuel,28,6,And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.~)
(1 Samuel,28,7,Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.~)
(1 Samuel,28,8,And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.~)
(1 Samuel,28,9,And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?~)
(1 Samuel,28,10,And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.~)
(1 Samuel,28,11,Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.~)
(1 Samuel,28,12,And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.~)
(1 Samuel,28,13,And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.~)
(1 Samuel,28,14,And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.~)
(1 Samuel,28,15,And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.~)
(1 Samuel,28,16,Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?~)
(1 Samuel,28,17,And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David:~)
(1 Samuel,28,18,Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.~)
(1 Samuel,28,19,Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,28,20,Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.~)
(1 Samuel,28,21,And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.~)
(1 Samuel,28,22,Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.~)
(1 Samuel,28,23,But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.~)
(1 Samuel,28,24,And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:~)
(1 Samuel,28,25,And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.~)
(1 Samuel,29,1,Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.~)
(1 Samuel,29,2,And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.~)
(1 Samuel,29,3,Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?  And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?~)
(1 Samuel,29,4,And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?~)
(1 Samuel,29,5,Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?~)
(1 Samuel,29,6,Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.~)
(1 Samuel,29,7,Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.~)
(1 Samuel,29,8,And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?~)
(1 Samuel,29,9,And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.~)
(1 Samuel,29,10,Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.~)
(1 Samuel,29,11,So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.~)
(1 Samuel,30,1,And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;~)
(1 Samuel,30,2,And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way.~)
(1 Samuel,30,3,So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.~)
(1 Samuel,30,4,Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.~)
(1 Samuel,30,5,And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.~)
(1 Samuel,30,6,And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.~)
(1 Samuel,30,7,And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.~)
(1 Samuel,30,8,And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.~)
(1 Samuel,30,9,So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.~)
(1 Samuel,30,10,But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.~)
(1 Samuel,30,11,And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;~)
(1 Samuel,30,12,And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.~)
(1 Samuel,30,13,And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.~)
(1 Samuel,30,14,We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.~)
(1 Samuel,30,15,And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.~)
(1 Samuel,30,16,And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.~)
(1 Samuel,30,17,And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.~)
(1 Samuel,30,18,And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives.~)
(1 Samuel,30,19,And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.~)
(1 Samuel,30,20,And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.~)
(1 Samuel,30,21,And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.~)
(1 Samuel,30,22,Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.~)
(1 Samuel,30,23,Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.~)
(1 Samuel,30,24,For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.~)
(1 Samuel,30,25,And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.~)
(1 Samuel,30,26,And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;~)
(1 Samuel,30,27,To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,~)
(1 Samuel,30,28,And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,~)

(1 Samuel,31,3,And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.~)
(1 Samuel,31,4,Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.~)
(1 Samuel,31,5,And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.~)
(1 Samuel,31,6,So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.~)
(1 Samuel,31,7,And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.~)
(1 Samuel,31,8,And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.~)

(1 Samuel,31,10,And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.~)
(1 Samuel,31,11,And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;~)

(1 Kings,1,7,And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.~)
(1 Kings,1,8,But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.~)
(1 Kings,1,9,And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:~)
(1 Kings,1,10,But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.~)
(1 Kings,1,11,Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?~)
(1 Kings,1,12,Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,1,13,Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?~)
(1 Kings,1,14,Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.~)
(1 Kings,1,15,And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.~)
(1 Kings,1,16,And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?~)
(1 Kings,1,17,And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.~)
(1 Kings,1,18,And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:~)
(1 Kings,1,19,And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.~)
(1 Kings,1,20,And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.~)
(1 Kings,1,21,Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.~)
(1 Kings,1,22,And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.~)
(1 Kings,1,23,And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.~)
(1 Kings,1,24,And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?~)
(1 Kings,1,25,For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.~)
(1 Kings,1,26,But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.~)
(1 Kings,1,27,Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?~)
(1 Kings,1,28,Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.~)
(1 Kings,1,29,And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,~)
(1 Kings,1,30,Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.~)
(1 Kings,1,31,Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.~)
(1 Kings,1,32,And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.~)
(1 Kings,1,33,The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:~)
(1 Kings,1,34,And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,1,35,Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.~)
(1 Kings,1,36,And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.~)
(1 Kings,1,37,As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.~)
(1 Kings,1,38,So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.~)
(1 Kings,1,39,And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,1,40,And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.~)
(1 Kings,1,41,And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?~)
(1 Kings,1,42,And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.~)
(1 Kings,1,43,And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.~)
(1 Kings,1,44,And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:~)
(1 Kings,1,45,And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.~)
(1 Kings,1,46,And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.~)
(1 Kings,1,47,And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.~)
(1 Kings,1,48,And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.~)
(1 Kings,1,49,And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.~)
(1 Kings,1,50,And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.~)
(1 Kings,1,51,And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.~)
(1 Kings,1,52,And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.~)
(1 Kings,1,53,So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.~)
(1 Kings,2,1,Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,~)
(1 Kings,2,2,I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;~)
(1 Kings,2,3,And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:~)
(1 Kings,2,4,That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,2,5,Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.~)
(1 Kings,2,6,Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.~)
(1 Kings,2,7,But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.~)
(1 Kings,2,8,And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.~)
(1 Kings,2,9,Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.~)
(1 Kings,2,10,So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.~)
(1 Kings,2,11,And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.~)
(1 Kings,2,12,Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.~)
(1 Kings,2,13,And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.~)
(1 Kings,2,14,He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.~)
(1 Kings,2,15,And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,2,16,And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.~)
(1 Kings,2,17,And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.~)
(1 Kings,2,18,And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.~)
(1 Kings,2,19,Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.~)
(1 Kings,2,20,Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.~)
(1 Kings,2,21,And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.~)
(1 Kings,2,22,And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.~)
(1 Kings,2,23,Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.~)
(1 Kings,2,24,Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.~)
(1 Kings,2,25,And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.~)
(1 Kings,2,26,And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.~)
(1 Kings,2,27,So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.~)
(1 Kings,2,28,Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.~)
(1 Kings,2,29,And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.~)
(1 Kings,2,30,And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.~)
(1 Kings,2,31,And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.~)
(1 Kings,2,32,And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.~)
(1 Kings,2,33,Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,2,34,So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.~)
(1 Kings,2,35,And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.~)
(1 Kings,2,36,And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.~)
(1 Kings,2,37,For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.~)
(1 Kings,2,38,And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.~)
(1 Kings,2,39,And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.~)
(1 Kings,2,40,And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.~)
(1 Kings,2,41,And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.~)
(1 Kings,2,42,And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.~)
(1 Kings,2,43,Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?~)
(1 Kings,2,44,The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;~)
(1 Kings,2,45,And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.~)
(1 Kings,2,46,So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,3,1,And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.~)
(1 Kings,3,2,Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.~)
(1 Kings,3,3,And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.~)
(1 Kings,3,4,And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.~)
(1 Kings,3,5,In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.~)
(1 Kings,3,6,And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.~)
(1 Kings,3,7,And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.~)
(1 Kings,3,8,And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.~)
(1 Kings,3,9,Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?~)
(1 Kings,3,10,And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.~)
(1 Kings,3,11,And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;~)
(1 Kings,3,12,Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.~)
(1 Kings,3,13,And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.~)
(1 Kings,3,14,And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.~)
(1 Kings,3,15,And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.~)
(1 Kings,3,16,Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.~)
(1 Kings,3,17,And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.~)
(1 Kings,3,18,And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.~)
(1 Kings,3,19,And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.~)
(1 Kings,3,20,And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.~)
(1 Kings,3,21,And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.~)
(1 Kings,3,22,And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.~)
(1 Kings,3,23,Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.~)
(1 Kings,3,24,And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.~)
(1 Kings,3,25,And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.~)
(1 Kings,3,26,Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.~)
(1 Kings,3,27,Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.~)
(1 Kings,3,28,And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.~)
(1 Kings,4,1,So king Solomon was king over all Israel.~)
(1 Kings,4,2,And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,~)
(1 Kings,4,3,Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.~)
(1 Kings,4,4,And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:~)
(1 Kings,4,5,And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:~)
(1 Kings,4,6,And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.~)
(1 Kings,4,7,And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.~)
(1 Kings,4,8,And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:~)
(1 Kings,4,9,The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan:~)
(1 Kings,4,10,The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:~)
(1 Kings,4,11,The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:~)
(1 Kings,4,12,Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:~)
(1 Kings,4,13,The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:~)
(1 Kings,4,14,Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:~)
(1 Kings,4,15,Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:~)
(1 Kings,4,16,Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:~)
(1 Kings,4,17,Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:~)
(1 Kings,4,18,Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:~)
(1 Kings,4,19,Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.~)
(1 Kings,4,20,Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.~)
(1 Kings,4,21,And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.~)
(1 Kings,4,22,And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,~)
(1 Kings,4,23,Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.~)
(1 Kings,4,24,For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.~)
(1 Kings,4,25,And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,4,26,And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.~)
(1 Kings,4,27,And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.~)
(1 Kings,4,28,Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.~)
(1 Kings,4,29,And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.~)
(1 Kings,4,30,And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.~)
(1 Kings,4,31,For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.~)
(1 Kings,4,32,And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.~)
(1 Kings,4,33,And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.~)
(1 Kings,4,34,And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.~)
(1 Kings,5,1,And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.~)
(1 Kings,5,2,And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,~)
(1 Kings,5,3,Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.~)
(1 Kings,5,4,But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.~)
(1 Kings,5,5,And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.~)
(1 Kings,5,6,Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.~)
(1 Kings,5,7,And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.~)
(1 Kings,5,8,And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.~)
(1 Kings,5,9,My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.~)
(1 Kings,5,10,So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.~)
(1 Kings,5,11,And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.~)
(1 Kings,5,12,And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.~)
(1 Kings,5,13,And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.~)
(1 Kings,5,14,And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.~)
(1 Kings,5,15,And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;~)
(1 Kings,5,16,Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.~)
(1 Kings,5,17,And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.~)
(1 Kings,5,18,And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.~)
(1 Kings,6,1,And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,6,2,And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.~)
(1 Kings,6,3,And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.~)
(1 Kings,6,4,And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.~)
(1 Kings,6,5,And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:~)
(1 Kings,6,6,The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.~)
(1 Kings,6,7,And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.~)
(1 Kings,6,8,The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.~)
(1 Kings,6,9,So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.~)
(1 Kings,6,10,And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.~)
(1 Kings,6,11,And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,~)
(1 Kings,6,12,Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:~)
(1 Kings,6,13,And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.~)
(1 Kings,6,14,So Solomon built the house, and finished it.~)
(1 Kings,6,15,And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.~)
(1 Kings,6,16,And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.~)
(1 Kings,6,17,And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.~)
(1 Kings,6,18,And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.~)
(1 Kings,6,19,And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,6,20,And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.~)
(1 Kings,6,21,So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.~)
(1 Kings,6,22,And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.~)
(1 Kings,6,23,And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.~)
(1 Kings,6,24,And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.~)
(1 Kings,6,25,And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.~)
(1 Kings,6,26,The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.~)
(1 Kings,6,27,And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.~)
(1 Kings,6,28,And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.~)
(1 Kings,6,29,And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.~)
(1 Kings,6,30,And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.~)
(1 Kings,6,31,And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.~)
(1 Kings,6,32,The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.~)
(1 Kings,6,33,So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.~)
(1 Kings,6,34,And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.~)
(1 Kings,6,35,And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.~)
(1 Kings,6,36,And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.~)
(1 Kings,6,37,In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:~)
(1 Kings,6,38,And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.~)
(1 Kings,7,1,But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.~)
(1 Kings,7,2,He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.~)
(1 Kings,7,3,And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.~)
(1 Kings,7,4,And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.~)
(1 Kings,7,5,And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.~)
(1 Kings,7,6,And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.~)
(1 Kings,7,7,Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.~)
(1 Kings,7,8,And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.~)
(1 Kings,7,9,All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.~)
(1 Kings,7,10,And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.~)
(1 Kings,7,11,And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.~)
(1 Kings,7,12,And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.~)
(1 Kings,7,13,And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.~)
(1 Kings,7,14,He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.~)
(1 Kings,7,15,For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.~)
(1 Kings,7,16,And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:~)
(1 Kings,7,17,And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.~)
(1 Kings,7,18,And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.~)
(1 Kings,7,19,And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.~)
(1 Kings,7,20,And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.~)
(1 Kings,7,21,And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.~)
(1 Kings,7,22,And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.~)
(1 Kings,7,23,And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.~)
(1 Kings,7,24,And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.~)
(1 Kings,7,25,It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.~)
(1 Kings,7,26,And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.~)
(1 Kings,7,27,And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.~)
(1 Kings,7,28,And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:~)
(1 Kings,7,29,And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.~)
(1 Kings,7,30,And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.~)
(1 Kings,7,31,And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.~)
(1 Kings,7,32,And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.~)
(1 Kings,7,33,And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.~)
(1 Kings,7,34,And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.~)
(1 Kings,7,35,And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.~)
(1 Kings,7,36,For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.~)
(1 Kings,7,37,After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.~)
(1 Kings,7,38,Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.~)
(1 Kings,7,39,And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.~)
(1 Kings,7,40,And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:~)
(1 Kings,7,41,The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;~)
(1 Kings,7,42,And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;~)
(1 Kings,7,43,And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;~)
(1 Kings,7,44,And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;~)
(1 Kings,7,45,And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.~)
(1 Kings,7,46,In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.~)
(1 Kings,7,47,And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.~)
(1 Kings,7,48,And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,~)
(1 Kings,7,49,And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,~)
(1 Kings,7,50,And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.~)
(1 Kings,7,51,So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,8,1,Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.~)
(1 Kings,8,2,And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.~)
(1 Kings,8,3,And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.~)
(1 Kings,8,4,And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.~)
(1 Kings,8,5,And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.~)
(1 Kings,8,6,And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims.~)
(1 Kings,8,7,For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.~)
(1 Kings,8,8,And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.~)
(1 Kings,8,9,There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.~)
(1 Kings,8,10,And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,~)
(1 Kings,8,11,So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,8,12,Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.~)
(1 Kings,8,13,I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.~)
(1 Kings,8,14,And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)~)
(1 Kings,8,15,And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,~)
(1 Kings,8,16,Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.~)
(1 Kings,8,17,And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,8,18,And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.~)
(1 Kings,8,19,Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.~)
(1 Kings,8,20,And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,8,21,And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.~)
(1 Kings,8,22,And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:~)
(1 Kings,8,23,And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:~)
(1 Kings,8,24,Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.~)
(1 Kings,8,25,Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.~)
(1 Kings,8,26,And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.~)
(1 Kings,8,27,But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?~)
(1 Kings,8,28,Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:~)
(1 Kings,8,29,That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.~)
(1 Kings,8,30,And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.~)
(1 Kings,8,31,If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:~)
(1 Kings,8,32,Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.~)
(1 Kings,8,33,When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:~)
(1 Kings,8,34,Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.~)
(1 Kings,8,35,When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:~)
(1 Kings,8,36,Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.~)
(1 Kings,8,37,If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;~)
(1 Kings,8,38,What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:~)
(1 Kings,8,39,Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)~)
(1 Kings,8,40,That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.~)
(1 Kings,8,41,Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;~)
(1 Kings,8,42,(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;~)
(1 Kings,8,43,Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.~)
(1 Kings,8,44,If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:~)
(1 Kings,8,45,Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.~)
(1 Kings,8,46,If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;~)
(1 Kings,8,47,Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;~)
(1 Kings,8,48,And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:~)
(1 Kings,8,49,Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,~)
(1 Kings,8,50,And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:~)
(1 Kings,8,51,For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:~)
(1 Kings,8,52,That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.~)
(1 Kings,8,53,For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.~)
(1 Kings,8,54,And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.~)
(1 Kings,8,55,And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,~)
(1 Kings,8,56,Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.~)
(1 Kings,8,57,The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:~)
(1 Kings,8,58,That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.~)
(1 Kings,8,59,And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:~)
(1 Kings,8,60,That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.~)
(1 Kings,8,61,Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.~)
(1 Kings,8,62,And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,8,63,And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,8,64,The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.~)
(1 Kings,8,65,And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.~)
(1 Kings,8,66,On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.~)
(1 Kings,9,1,And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do,~)
(1 Kings,9,2,That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.~)
(1 Kings,9,3,And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.~)
(1 Kings,9,4,And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:~)
(1 Kings,9,5,Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,9,6,But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:~)
(1 Kings,9,7,Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:~)
(1 Kings,9,8,And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?~)
(1 Kings,9,9,And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.~)
(1 Kings,9,10,And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,~)
(1 Kings,9,11,(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.~)
(1 Kings,9,12,And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.~)
(1 Kings,9,13,And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.~)
(1 Kings,9,14,And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.~)
(1 Kings,9,15,And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.~)
(1 Kings,9,16,For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.~)
(1 Kings,9,17,And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,~)
(1 Kings,9,18,And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,~)
(1 Kings,9,19,And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.~)
(1 Kings,9,20,And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,~)
(1 Kings,9,21,Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.~)
(1 Kings,9,22,But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.~)
(1 Kings,9,23,These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.~)
(1 Kings,9,24,But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.~)
(1 Kings,9,25,And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.~)
(1 Kings,9,26,And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.~)
(1 Kings,9,27,And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,9,28,And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,10,1,And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.~)
(1 Kings,10,2,And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.~)
(1 Kings,10,3,And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.~)
(1 Kings,10,4,And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built,~)
(1 Kings,10,5,And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.~)
(1 Kings,10,6,And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.~)
(1 Kings,10,7,Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.~)
(1 Kings,10,8,Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.~)
(1 Kings,10,9,Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.~)
(1 Kings,10,10,And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,10,11,And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.~)
(1 Kings,10,12,And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.~)
(1 Kings,10,13,And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.~)
(1 Kings,10,14,Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,~)
(1 Kings,10,15,Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.~)
(1 Kings,10,16,And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.~)
(1 Kings,10,17,And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.~)
(1 Kings,10,18,Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.~)
(1 Kings,10,19,The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.~)
(1 Kings,10,20,And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.~)
(1 Kings,10,21,And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,10,22,For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.~)
(1 Kings,10,23,So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.~)
(1 Kings,10,24,And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.~)
(1 Kings,10,25,And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.~)
(1 Kings,10,26,And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.~)
(1 Kings,10,27,And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.~)
(1 Kings,10,28,And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.~)
(1 Kings,10,29,And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.~)
(1 Kings,11,1,But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:~)
(1 Kings,11,2,Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.~)
(1 Kings,11,3,And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.~)
(1 Kings,11,4,For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.~)
(1 Kings,11,5,For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.~)
(1 Kings,11,6,And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.~)
(1 Kings,11,7,Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.~)
(1 Kings,11,8,And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.~)
(1 Kings,11,9,And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,~)
(1 Kings,11,10,And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.~)
(1 Kings,11,11,Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.~)
(1 Kings,11,12,Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.~)
(1 Kings,11,13,Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.~)
(1 Kings,11,14,And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.~)
(1 Kings,11,15,For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;~)
(1 Kings,11,16,(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)~)
(1 Kings,11,17,That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.~)
(1 Kings,11,18,And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.~)
(1 Kings,11,19,And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.~)
(1 Kings,11,20,And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.~)
(1 Kings,11,21,And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.~)
(1 Kings,11,22,Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.~)
(1 Kings,11,23,And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:~)
(1 Kings,11,24,And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.~)
(1 Kings,11,25,And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.~)
(1 Kings,11,26,And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.~)
(1 Kings,11,27,And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.~)
(1 Kings,11,28,And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.~)
(1 Kings,11,29,And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:~)
(1 Kings,11,30,And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:~)
(1 Kings,11,31,And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:~)
(1 Kings,11,32,(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)~)
(1 Kings,11,33,Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.~)
(1 Kings,11,34,Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:~)
(1 Kings,11,35,But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.~)
(1 Kings,11,36,And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.~)
(1 Kings,11,37,And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.~)
(1 Kings,11,38,And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.~)
(1 Kings,11,39,And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.~)
(1 Kings,11,40,Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,11,41,And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?~)
(1 Kings,11,42,And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.~)
(1 Kings,11,43,And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,12,1,And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.~)
(1 Kings,12,2,And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)~)
(1 Kings,12,3,That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,~)
(1 Kings,12,4,Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.~)
(1 Kings,12,5,And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.~)
(1 Kings,12,6,And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?~)
(1 Kings,12,7,And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.~)
(1 Kings,12,8,But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:~)
(1 Kings,12,9,And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?~)
(1 Kings,12,10,And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.~)
(1 Kings,12,11,And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.~)
(1 Kings,12,12,So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.~)
(1 Kings,12,13,And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him;~)
(1 Kings,12,14,And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.~)
(1 Kings,12,15,Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.~)
(1 Kings,12,16,So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.~)
(1 Kings,12,17,But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.~)
(1 Kings,12,18,Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.~)
(1 Kings,12,19,So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.~)
(1 Kings,12,20,And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.~)
(1 Kings,12,21,And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.~)
(1 Kings,12,22,But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,~)
(1 Kings,12,23,Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,~)
(1 Kings,12,24,Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,12,25,Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.~)
(1 Kings,12,26,And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:~)
(1 Kings,12,27,If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.~)
(1 Kings,12,28,Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.~)
(1 Kings,12,29,And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.~)
(1 Kings,12,30,And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.~)
(1 Kings,12,31,And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.~)
(1 Kings,12,32,And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.~)
(1 Kings,12,33,So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.~)
(1 Kings,13,1,And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.~)
(1 Kings,13,2,And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.~)
(1 Kings,13,3,And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.~)
(1 Kings,13,4,And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.~)
(1 Kings,13,5,The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,13,6,And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.~)
(1 Kings,13,7,And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.~)
(1 Kings,13,8,And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place:~)
(1 Kings,13,9,For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest.~)
(1 Kings,13,10,So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel.~)
(1 Kings,13,11,Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father.~)
(1 Kings,13,12,And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.~)
(1 Kings,13,13,And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,~)
(1 Kings,13,14,And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.~)
(1 Kings,13,15,Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.~)
(1 Kings,13,16,And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:~)
(1 Kings,13,17,For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.~)
(1 Kings,13,18,He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.~)
(1 Kings,13,19,So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.~)
(1 Kings,13,20,And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:~)
(1 Kings,13,21,And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee,~)
(1 Kings,13,22,But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.~)
(1 Kings,13,23,And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.~)
(1 Kings,13,24,And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.~)
(1 Kings,13,25,And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.~)
(1 Kings,13,26,And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.~)
(1 Kings,13,27,And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him.~)
(1 Kings,13,28,And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass.~)
(1 Kings,13,29,And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.~)
(1 Kings,13,30,And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!~)
(1 Kings,13,31,And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:~)
(1 Kings,13,32,For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.~)
(1 Kings,13,33,After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.~)
(1 Kings,13,34,And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.~)
(1 Kings,14,1,At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.~)
(1 Kings,14,2,And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.~)
(1 Kings,14,3,And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.~)
(1 Kings,14,4,And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.~)
(1 Kings,14,5,And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman.~)
(1 Kings,14,6,And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.~)
(1 Kings,14,7,Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel,~)
(1 Kings,14,8,And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes;~)
(1 Kings,14,9,But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:~)
(1 Kings,14,10,Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.~)
(1 Kings,14,11,Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it.~)
(1 Kings,14,12,Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.~)
(1 Kings,14,13,And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.~)
(1 Kings,14,14,Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.~)
(1 Kings,14,15,For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.~)
(1 Kings,14,16,And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.~)
(1 Kings,14,17,And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;~)
(1 Kings,14,18,And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.~)
(1 Kings,14,19,And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,14,20,And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,14,21,And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.~)
(1 Kings,14,22,And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.~)
(1 Kings,14,23,For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.~)
(1 Kings,14,24,And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,14,25,And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:~)
(1 Kings,14,26,And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.~)
(1 Kings,14,27,And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house.~)
(1 Kings,14,28,And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.~)
(1 Kings,14,29,Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(1 Kings,14,30,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.~)
(1 Kings,14,31,And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,15,1,Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah.~)
(1 Kings,15,2,Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.~)
(1 Kings,15,3,And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father.~)
(1 Kings,15,4,Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:~)
(1 Kings,15,5,Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.~)
(1 Kings,15,6,And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.~)
(1 Kings,15,7,Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.~)
(1 Kings,15,8,And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,15,9,And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.~)
(1 Kings,15,10,And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.~)
(1 Kings,15,11,And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father.~)
(1 Kings,15,12,And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.~)
(1 Kings,15,13,And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.~)
(1 Kings,15,14,But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days.~)
(1 Kings,15,15,And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.~)
(1 Kings,15,16,And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.~)
(1 Kings,15,17,And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.~)
(1 Kings,15,18,Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,~)
(1 Kings,15,19,There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.~)
(1 Kings,15,20,So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.~)
(1 Kings,15,21,And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.~)
(1 Kings,15,22,Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.~)
(1 Kings,15,23,The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.~)
(1 Kings,15,24,And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,15,25,And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.~)
(1 Kings,15,26,And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.~)
(1 Kings,15,27,And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.~)
(1 Kings,15,28,Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,15,29,And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:~)
(1 Kings,15,30,Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.~)
(1 Kings,15,31,Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(1 Kings,15,32,And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.~)
(1 Kings,15,33,In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.~)
(1 Kings,15,34,And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.~)
(1 Kings,16,1,Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying,~)
(1 Kings,16,2,Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;~)
(1 Kings,16,3,Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.~)
(1 Kings,16,4,Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.~)
(1 Kings,16,5,Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(1 Kings,16,6,So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,16,7,And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.~)
(1 Kings,16,8,In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.~)
(1 Kings,16,9,And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.~)
(1 Kings,16,10,And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,16,11,And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends.~)
(1 Kings,16,12,Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.~)
(1 Kings,16,13,For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.~)
(1 Kings,16,14,Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(1 Kings,16,15,In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.~)
(1 Kings,16,16,And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.~)
(1 Kings,16,17,And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.~)
(1 Kings,16,18,And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died.~)
(1 Kings,16,19,For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.~)
(1 Kings,16,20,Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(1 Kings,16,21,Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.~)
(1 Kings,16,22,But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.~)
(1 Kings,16,23,In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.~)
(1 Kings,16,24,And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,16,25,But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.~)
(1 Kings,16,26,For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.~)
(1 Kings,16,27,Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(1 Kings,16,28,So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,16,29,And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.~)
(1 Kings,16,30,And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.~)
(1 Kings,16,31,And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.~)
(1 Kings,16,32,And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,16,33,And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.~)
(1 Kings,16,34,In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.~)
(1 Kings,17,1,And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.~)
(1 Kings,17,2,And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,~)
(1 Kings,17,3,Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.~)
(1 Kings,17,4,And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.~)
(1 Kings,17,5,So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.~)
(1 Kings,17,6,And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.~)
(1 Kings,17,7,And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.~)
(1 Kings,17,8,And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,~)
(1 Kings,17,9,Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.~)
(1 Kings,17,10,So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.~)
(1 Kings,17,11,And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.~)
(1 Kings,17,12,And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.~)
(1 Kings,17,13,And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.~)
(1 Kings,17,14,For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.~)
(1 Kings,17,15,And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.~)
(1 Kings,17,16,And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.~)
(1 Kings,17,17,And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.~)
(1 Kings,17,18,And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?~)
(1 Kings,17,19,And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.~)
(1 Kings,17,20,And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?~)
(1 Kings,17,21,And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again.~)
(1 Kings,17,22,And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.~)
(1 Kings,17,23,And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.~)
(1 Kings,17,24,And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.~)
(1 Kings,18,1,And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.~)
(1 Kings,18,2,And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,18,3,And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:~)
(1 Kings,18,4,For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)~)
(1 Kings,18,5,And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.~)
(1 Kings,18,6,So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.~)
(1 Kings,18,7,And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?~)
(1 Kings,18,8,And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.~)
(1 Kings,18,9,And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?~)
(1 Kings,18,10,As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.~)
(1 Kings,18,11,And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.~)
(1 Kings,18,12,And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.~)
(1 Kings,18,13,Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?~)
(1 Kings,18,14,And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.~)
(1 Kings,18,15,And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.~)
(1 Kings,18,16,So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.~)
(1 Kings,18,17,And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?~)
(1 Kings,18,18,And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.~)
(1 Kings,18,19,Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.~)
(1 Kings,18,20,So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.~)
(1 Kings,18,21,And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.~)
(1 Kings,18,22,Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.~)
(1 Kings,18,23,Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:~)
(1 Kings,18,24,And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.~)
(1 Kings,18,25,And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.~)
(1 Kings,18,26,And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.~)
(1 Kings,18,27,And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.~)
(1 Kings,18,28,And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.~)
(1 Kings,18,29,And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.~)
(1 Kings,18,30,And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.~)
(1 Kings,18,31,And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:~)
(1 Kings,18,32,And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.~)
(1 Kings,18,33,And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.~)
(1 Kings,18,34,And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.~)
(1 Kings,18,35,And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.~)
(1 Kings,18,36,And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.~)
(1 Kings,18,37,Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.~)
(1 Kings,18,38,Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.~)
(1 Kings,18,39,And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.~)
(1 Kings,18,40,And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.~)
(1 Kings,18,41,And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.~)
(1 Kings,18,42,So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,~)
(1 Kings,18,43,And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.~)
(1 Kings,18,44,And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.~)
(1 Kings,18,45,And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.~)
(1 Kings,18,46,And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.~)
(1 Kings,19,1,And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.~)
(1 Kings,19,2,Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.~)
(1 Kings,19,3,And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.~)
(1 Kings,19,4,But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.~)
(1 Kings,19,5,And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.~)
(1 Kings,19,6,And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.~)
(1 Kings,19,7,And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.~)
(1 Kings,19,8,And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.~)
(1 Kings,19,9,And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?~)
(1 Kings,19,10,And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.~)
(1 Kings,19,11,And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:~)
(1 Kings,19,12,And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.~)
(1 Kings,19,13,And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?~)
(1 Kings,19,14,And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.~)
(1 Kings,19,15,And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:~)
(1 Kings,19,16,And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.~)
(1 Kings,19,17,And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.~)
(1 Kings,19,18,Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.~)
(1 Kings,19,19,So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.~)
(1 Kings,19,20,And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?~)
(1 Kings,19,21,And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.~)
(1 Kings,20,1,And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.~)
(1 Kings,20,2,And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,~)
(1 Kings,20,3,Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.~)
(1 Kings,20,4,And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.~)
(1 Kings,20,5,And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;~)
(1 Kings,20,6,Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.~)
(1 Kings,20,7,Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.~)
(1 Kings,20,8,And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.~)
(1 Kings,20,9,Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again.~)
(1 Kings,20,10,And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.~)
(1 Kings,20,11,And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.~)
(1 Kings,20,12,And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.~)
(1 Kings,20,13,And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,20,14,And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.~)
(1 Kings,20,15,Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.~)
(1 Kings,20,16,And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.~)
(1 Kings,20,17,And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,20,18,And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.~)
(1 Kings,20,19,So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them.~)
(1 Kings,20,20,And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen.~)
(1 Kings,20,21,And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.~)
(1 Kings,20,22,And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.~)
(1 Kings,20,23,And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.~)
(1 Kings,20,24,And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms:~)
(1 Kings,20,25,And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.~)
(1 Kings,20,26,And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.~)
(1 Kings,20,27,And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.~)
(1 Kings,20,28,And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,20,29,And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.~)
(1 Kings,20,30,But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.~)
(1 Kings,20,31,And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.~)
(1 Kings,20,32,So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.~)
(1 Kings,20,33,Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.~)
(1 Kings,20,34,And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.~)
(1 Kings,20,35,And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him.~)
(1 Kings,20,36,Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.~)
(1 Kings,20,37,Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.~)
(1 Kings,20,38,So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.~)
(1 Kings,20,39,And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.~)
(1 Kings,20,40,And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.~)
(1 Kings,20,41,And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.~)
(1 Kings,20,42,And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.~)
(1 Kings,20,43,And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,21,1,And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,21,2,And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.~)
(1 Kings,21,3,And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.~)
(1 Kings,21,4,And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.~)
(1 Kings,21,5,But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?~)
(1 Kings,21,6,And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.~)
(1 Kings,21,7,And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.~)
(1 Kings,21,8,So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.~)
(1 Kings,21,9,And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:~)
(1 Kings,21,10,And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.~)
(1 Kings,21,11,And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.~)
(1 Kings,21,12,They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.~)
(1 Kings,21,13,And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.~)
(1 Kings,21,14,Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.~)
(1 Kings,21,15,And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.~)
(1 Kings,21,16,And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.~)
(1 Kings,21,17,And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,~)
(1 Kings,21,18,Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.~)
(1 Kings,21,19,And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.~)
(1 Kings,21,20,And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.~)
(1 Kings,21,21,Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,~)
(1 Kings,21,22,And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.~)
(1 Kings,21,23,And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.~)
(1 Kings,21,24,Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.~)
(1 Kings,21,25,But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.~)
(1 Kings,21,26,And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,21,27,And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.~)
(1 Kings,21,28,And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,~)
(1 Kings,21,29,Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.~)
(1 Kings,22,1,And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.~)
(1 Kings,22,2,And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,22,3,And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?~)
(1 Kings,22,4,And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.~)
(1 Kings,22,5,And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.~)
(1 Kings,22,6,Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.~)
(1 Kings,22,7,And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?~)
(1 Kings,22,8,And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.~)
(1 Kings,22,9,Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.~)
(1 Kings,22,10,And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.~)
(1 Kings,22,11,And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them.~)
(1 Kings,22,12,And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king's hand.~)
(1 Kings,22,13,And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.~)
(1 Kings,22,14,And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.~)
(1 Kings,22,15,So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.~)
(1 Kings,22,16,And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?~)
(1 Kings,22,17,And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.~)
(1 Kings,22,18,And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?~)
(1 Kings,22,19,And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.~)
(1 Kings,22,20,And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.~)
(1 Kings,22,21,And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.~)
(1 Kings,22,22,And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.~)
(1 Kings,22,23,Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.~)
(1 Kings,22,24,But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?~)
(1 Kings,22,25,And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.~)
(1 Kings,22,26,And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;~)
(1 Kings,22,27,And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.~)
(1 Kings,22,28,And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.~)
(1 Kings,22,29,So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.~)
(1 Kings,22,30,And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.~)
(1 Kings,22,31,But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,22,32,And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.~)
(1 Kings,22,33,And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.~)
(1 Kings,22,34,And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.~)
(1 Kings,22,35,And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.~)
(1 Kings,22,36,And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.~)
(1 Kings,22,37,So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.~)
(1 Kings,22,38,And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.~)
(1 Kings,22,39,Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(1 Kings,22,40,So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,22,41,And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,22,42,Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.~)
(1 Kings,22,43,And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.~)
(1 Kings,22,44,And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.~)
(1 Kings,22,45,Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(1 Kings,22,46,And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.~)
(1 Kings,22,47,There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.~)
(1 Kings,22,48,Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.~)
(1 Kings,22,49,Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.~)
(1 Kings,22,50,And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.~)
(1 Kings,22,51,Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.~)
(1 Kings,22,52,And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:~)
(1 Kings,22,53,For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.~)

(Amos,7,12,Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:~)
(Amos,7,13,But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court.~)

(Amos,8,11,Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:~)
(Amos,8,12,And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.~)
(Amos,8,13,In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.~)
(Amos,8,14,They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.~)
(Amos,9,1,I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.~)
(Amos,9,2,Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:~)
(Amos,9,3,And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:~)
(Amos,9,4,And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.~)
(Amos,9,5,And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.~)
(Amos,9,6,It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.~)
(Amos,9,7,Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?~)
(Amos,9,8,Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.~)
(Amos,9,9,For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.~)
(Amos,9,10,All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.~)
(Amos,9,11,In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:~)
(Amos,9,12,That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.~)
(Amos,9,13,Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.~)
(Amos,9,14,And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.~)
(Amos,9,15,And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.~)
(John,1,1,In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.~)
(John,1,2,The same was in the beginning with God.~)
(John,1,3,All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.~)
(John,1,4,In him was life; and the life was the light of men.~)
(John,1,5,And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.~)
(John,1,6,There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.~)
(John,1,7,The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.~)
(John,1,8,He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.~)
(John,1,9,That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.~)
(John,1,10,He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.~)
(John,1,11,He came unto his own, and his own received him not.~)
(John,1,12,But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:~)
(John,1,13,Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.~)
(John,1,14,And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.~)
(John,1,15,John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.~)
(John,1,16,And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.~)
(John,1,17,For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.~)
(John,1,18,No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.~)
(John,1,19,And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?~)
(John,1,20,And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.~)
(John,1,21,And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.~)
(John,1,22,Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?~)
(John,1,23,He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.~)
(John,1,24,And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.~)
(John,1,25,And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?~)
(John,1,26,John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;~)
(John,1,27,He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.~)
(John,1,28,These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.~)
(John,1,29,The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.~)
(John,1,30,This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.~)
(John,1,31,And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.~)
(John,1,32,And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.~)
(John,1,33,And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.~)
(John,1,34,And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.~)
(John,1,35,Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;~)
(John,1,36,And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!~)
(John,1,37,And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.~)
(John,1,38,Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?~)
(John,1,39,He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.~)
(John,1,40,One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.~)
(John,1,41,He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.~)
(John,1,42,And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.~)
(John,1,43,The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.~)
(John,1,44,Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.~)
(John,1,45,Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.~)
(John,1,46,And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.~)
(John,1,47,Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!~)
(John,1,48,Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.~)
(John,1,49,Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.~)
(John,1,50,Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.~)
(John,1,51,And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.~)
(John,2,1,And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:~)
(John,2,2,And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.~)
(John,2,3,And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.~)
(John,2,4,Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.~)
(John,2,5,His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.~)
(John,2,6,And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.~)
(John,2,7,Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.~)
(John,2,8,And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.~)
(John,2,9,When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,~)
(John,2,10,And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.~)
(John,2,11,This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.~)
(John,2,12,After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.~)
(John,2,13,And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.~)
(John,2,14,And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:~)
(John,2,15,And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;~)
(John,2,16,And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.~)
(John,2,17,And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.~)
(John,2,18,Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?~)
(John,2,19,Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.~)
(John,2,20,Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?~)
(John,2,21,But he spake of the temple of his body.~)
(John,2,22,When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.~)
(John,2,23,Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.~)
(John,2,24,But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,~)
(John,2,25,And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.~)
(John,3,1,There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:~)
(John,3,2,The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.~)
(John,3,3,Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.~)
(John,3,4,Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?~)
(John,3,5,Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.~)
(John,3,6,That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.~)
(John,3,7,Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.~)
(John,3,8,The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.~)
(John,3,9,Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?~)
(John,3,10,Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?~)
(John,3,11,Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.~)
(John,3,12,If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?~)
(John,3,13,And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.~)
(John,3,14,And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:~)
(John,3,15,That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.~)
(John,3,16,For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.~)
(John,3,17,For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.~)
(John,3,18,He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.~)
(John,3,19,And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.~)
(John,3,20,For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.~)
(John,3,21,But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.~)
(John,3,22,After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.~)
(John,3,23,And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.~)
(John,3,24,For John was not yet cast into prison.~)
(John,3,25,Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.~)
(John,3,26,And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.~)
(John,3,27,John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.~)
(John,3,28,Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.~)
(John,3,29,He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.~)
(John,3,30,He must increase, but I must decrease.~)
(John,3,31,He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.~)
(John,3,32,And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.~)
(John,3,33,He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.~)
(John,3,34,For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.~)
(John,3,35,The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.~)
(John,3,36,He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.~)
(John,4,1,When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,~)
(John,4,2,(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)~)
(John,4,3,He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.~)
(John,4,4,And he must needs go through Samaria.~)
(John,4,5,Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.~)
(John,4,6,Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.~)
(John,4,7,There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.~)
(John,4,8,(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)~)
(John,4,9,Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.~)
(John,4,10,Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.~)
(John,4,11,The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?~)
(John,4,12,Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?~)
(John,4,13,Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:~)
(John,4,14,But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.~)
(John,4,15,The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.~)
(John,4,16,Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.~)
(John,4,17,The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:~)
(John,4,18,For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.~)
(John,4,19,The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.~)
(John,4,20,Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.~)
(John,4,21,Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.~)
(John,4,22,Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.~)
(John,4,23,But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.~)
(John,4,24,God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.~)
(John,4,25,The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.~)
(John,4,26,Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.~)
(John,4,27,And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?~)
(John,4,28,The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,~)
(John,4,29,Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?~)
(John,4,30,Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.~)
(John,4,31,In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.~)
(John,4,32,But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.~)
(John,4,33,Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?~)
(John,4,34,Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.~)
(John,4,35,Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.~)
(John,4,36,And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.~)
(John,4,37,And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.~)
(John,4,38,I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.~)
(John,4,39,And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.~)
(John,4,40,So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.~)
(John,4,41,And many more believed because of his own word;~)
(John,4,42,And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.~)
(John,4,43,Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.~)
(John,4,44,For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.~)
(John,4,45,Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.~)
(John,4,46,So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.~)
(John,4,47,When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.~)
(John,4,48,Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.~)
(John,4,49,The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.~)
(John,4,50,Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.~)
(John,4,51,And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.~)
(John,4,52,Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.~)
(John,4,53,So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.~)
(John,4,54,This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.~)
(John,5,1,After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.~)
(John,5,2,Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.~)
(John,5,3,In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.~)
(John,5,4,For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.~)
(John,5,5,And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.~)
(John,5,6,When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?~)
(John,5,7,The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.~)
(John,5,8,Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.~)
(John,5,9,And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.~)
(John,5,10,The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.~)
(John,5,11,He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.~)
(John,5,12,Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?~)
(John,5,13,And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.~)
(John,5,14,Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.~)
(John,5,15,The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.~)
(John,5,16,And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.~)
(John,5,17,But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.~)
(John,5,18,Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.~)
(John,5,19,Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.~)
(John,5,20,For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.~)
(John,5,21,For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.~)
(John,5,22,For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:~)
(John,5,23,That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.~)
(John,5,24,Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.~)
(John,5,25,Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.~)
(John,5,26,For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;~)
(John,5,27,And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.~)
(John,5,28,Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,~)
(John,5,29,And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.~)
(John,5,30,I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.~)
(John,5,31,If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.~)
(John,5,32,There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.~)
(John,5,33,Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.~)
(John,5,34,But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.~)
(John,5,35,He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.~)
(John,5,36,But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.~)
(John,5,37,And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.~)
(John,5,38,And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.~)
(John,5,39,Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.~)
(John,5,40,And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.~)
(John,5,41,I receive not honour from men.~)
(John,5,42,But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.~)
(John,5,43,I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.~)
(John,5,44,How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?~)
(John,5,45,Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.~)
(John,5,46,For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.~)
(John,5,47,But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?~)
(John,6,1,After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.~)
(John,6,2,And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.~)
(John,6,3,And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.~)
(John,6,4,And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.~)
(John,6,5,When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?~)
(John,6,6,And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.~)
(John,6,7,Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.~)
(John,6,8,One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,~)
(John,6,9,There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?~)
(John,6,10,And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.~)
(John,6,11,And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.~)
(John,6,12,When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.~)
(John,6,13,Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.~)
(John,6,14,Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.~)
(John,6,15,When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.~)
(John,6,16,And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,~)
(John,6,17,And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.~)
(John,6,18,And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.~)
(John,6,19,So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.~)
(John,6,20,But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.~)
(John,6,21,Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.~)
(John,6,22,The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;~)
(John,6,23,(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)~)
(John,6,24,When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.~)
(John,6,25,And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?~)
(John,6,26,Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.~)
(John,6,27,Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.~)
(John,6,28,Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?~)
(John,6,29,Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.~)
(John,6,30,They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?~)
(John,6,31,Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.~)
(John,6,32,Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.~)
(John,6,33,For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.~)
(John,6,34,Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.~)
(John,6,35,And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.~)
(John,6,36,But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.~)
(John,6,37,All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.~)
(John,6,38,For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.~)
(John,6,39,And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.~)
(John,6,40,And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.~)
(John,6,41,The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.~)
(John,6,42,And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?~)
(John,6,43,Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.~)
(John,6,44,No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.~)
(John,6,45,It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.~)
(John,6,46,Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.~)
(John,6,47,Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.~)
(John,6,48,I am that bread of life.~)
(John,6,49,Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.~)
(John,6,50,This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.~)
(John,6,51,I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.~)
(John,6,52,The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?~)
(John,6,53,Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.~)
(John,6,54,Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.~)
(John,6,55,For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.~)
(John,6,56,He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.~)
(John,6,57,As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.~)
(John,6,58,This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.~)
(John,6,59,These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.~)
(John,6,60,Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?~)
(John,6,61,When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?~)
(John,6,62,What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?~)
(John,6,63,It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.~)
(John,6,64,But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.~)
(John,6,65,And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.~)
(John,6,66,From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.~)
(John,6,67,Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?~)
(John,6,68,Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.~)
(John,6,69,And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.~)
(John,6,70,Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?~)
(John,6,71,He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.~)
(John,7,1,After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.~)
(John,7,2,Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.~)
(John,7,3,His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.~)
(John,7,4,For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.~)
(John,7,5,For neither did his brethren believe in him.~)
(John,7,6,Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.~)
(John,7,7,The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.~)
(John,7,8,Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.~)
(John,7,9,When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.~)
(John,7,10,But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.~)
(John,7,11,Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?~)
(John,7,12,And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.~)
(John,7,13,Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.~)
(John,7,14,Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.~)
(John,7,15,And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?~)
(John,7,16,Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.~)
(John,7,17,If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.~)
(John,7,18,He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.~)
(John,7,19,Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?  Why go ye about to kill me?~)
(John,7,20,The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?~)
(John,7,21,Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.~)
(John,7,22,Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.~)
(John,7,23,If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?~)
(John,7,24,Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.~)
(John,7,25,Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?~)
(John,7,26,But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?~)
(John,7,27,Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.~)
(John,7,28,Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.~)
(John,7,29,But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.~)
(John,7,30,Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.~)
(John,7,31,And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?~)
(John,7,32,The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.~)
(John,7,33,Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.~)
(John,7,34,Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.~)
(John,7,35,Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?~)
(John,7,36,What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?~)
(John,7,37,In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.~)
(John,7,38,He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.~)
(John,7,39,(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)~)
(John,7,40,Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.~)
(John,7,41,Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?~)
(John,7,42,Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?~)
(John,7,43,So there was a division among the people because of him.~)
(John,7,44,And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.~)
(John,7,45,Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?~)
(John,7,46,The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.~)
(John,7,47,Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?~)
(John,7,48,Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?~)
(John,7,49,But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.~)
(John,7,50,Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)~)
(John,7,51,Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?~)
(John,7,52,They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.~)
(John,7,53,And every man went unto his own house.~)
(John,8,1,Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.~)
(John,8,2,And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.~)
(John,8,3,And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,~)
(John,8,4,They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.~)
(John,8,5,Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?~)
(John,8,6,This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.~)
(John,8,7,So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.~)
(John,8,8,And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.~)
(John,8,9,And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.~)
(John,8,10,When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?~)
(John,8,11,She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.~)
(John,8,12,Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.~)
(John,8,13,The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.~)
(John,8,14,Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.~)
(John,8,15,Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.~)
(John,8,16,And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.~)
(John,8,17,It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.~)
(John,8,18,I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.~)
(John,8,19,Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.~)
(John,8,20,These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.~)
(John,8,21,Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.~)
(John,8,22,Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.~)
(John,8,23,And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.~)
(John,8,24,I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.~)
(John,8,25,Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.~)
(John,8,26,I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.~)
(John,8,27,They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.~)
(John,8,28,Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.~)
(John,8,29,And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.~)
(John,8,30,As he spake these words, many believed on him.~)
(John,8,31,Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;~)
(John,8,32,And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.~)
(John,8,33,They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?~)
(John,8,34,Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.~)
(John,8,35,And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.~)
(John,8,36,If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.~)
(John,8,37,I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.~)
(John,8,38,I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.~)
(John,8,39,They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.~)
(John,8,40,But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.~)
(John,8,41,Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.~)
(John,8,42,Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.~)
(John,8,43,Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.~)
(John,8,44,Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.~)
(John,8,45,And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.~)
(John,8,46,Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?~)
(John,8,47,He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.~)
(John,8,48,Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?~)
(John,8,49,Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.~)
(John,8,50,And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.~)
(John,8,51,Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.~)
(John,8,52,Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.~)
(John,8,53,Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?~)
(John,8,54,Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:~)
(John,8,55,Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.~)
(John,8,56,Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.~)
(John,8,57,Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?~)
(John,8,58,Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.~)
(John,8,59,Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.~)
(John,9,1,And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.~)
(John,9,2,And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?~)
(John,9,3,Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.~)
(John,9,4,I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.~)
(John,9,5,As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.~)
(John,9,6,When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,~)
(John,9,7,And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.~)
(John,9,8,The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?~)
(John,9,9,Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.~)
(John,9,10,Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?~)
(John,9,11,He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.~)
(John,9,12,Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.~)
(John,9,13,They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.~)
(John,9,14,And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.~)
(John,9,15,Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.~)
(John,9,16,Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.~)
(John,9,17,They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.~)
(John,9,18,But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.~)
(John,9,19,And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?~)
(John,9,20,His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:~)
(John,9,21,But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.~)
(John,9,22,These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.~)
(John,9,23,Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.~)
(John,9,24,Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.~)
(John,9,25,He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.~)
(John,9,26,Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?~)
(John,9,27,He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?~)
(John,9,28,Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.~)
(John,9,29,We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.~)
(John,9,30,The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.~)
(John,9,31,Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.~)
(John,9,32,Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.~)
(John,9,33,If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.~)
(John,9,34,They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.~)
(John,9,35,Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?~)
(John,9,36,He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?~)
(John,9,37,And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.~)
(John,9,38,And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.~)
(John,9,39,And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.~)
(John,9,40,And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?~)
(John,9,41,Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.~)
(John,10,1,Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.~)
(John,10,2,But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.~)
(John,10,3,To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.~)
(John,10,4,And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.~)
(John,10,5,And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.~)
(John,10,6,This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.~)
(John,10,7,Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.~)
(John,10,8,All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.~)
(John,10,9,I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.~)
(John,10,10,The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.~)
(John,10,11,I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.~)
(John,10,12,But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.~)
(John,10,13,The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.~)
(John,10,14,I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.~)
(John,10,15,As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.~)
(John,10,16,And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.~)
(John,10,17,Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.~)
(John,10,18,No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.~)
(John,10,19,There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.~)
(John,10,20,And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?~)
(John,10,21,Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?~)
(John,10,22,And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.~)
(John,10,23,And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.~)
(John,10,24,Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.~)
(John,10,25,Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.~)
(John,10,26,But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.~)
(John,10,27,My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:~)
(John,10,28,And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.~)
(John,10,29,My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.~)
(John,10,30,I and my Father are one.~)
(John,10,31,Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.~)
(John,10,32,Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?~)
(John,10,33,The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.~)
(John,10,34,Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?~)
(John,10,35,If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;~)
(John,10,36,Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?~)
(John,10,37,If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.~)
(John,10,38,But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.~)
(John,10,39,Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,~)
(John,10,40,And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.~)
(John,10,41,And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.~)
(John,10,42,And many believed on him there.~)
(John,11,1,Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.~)
(John,11,2,(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)~)
(John,11,3,Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.~)
(John,11,4,When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.~)
(John,11,5,Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.~)
(John,11,6,When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.~)
(John,11,7,Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.~)
(John,11,8,His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?~)
(John,11,9,Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.~)
(John,11,10,But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.~)
(John,11,11,These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.~)
(John,11,12,Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.~)
(John,11,13,Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.~)
(John,11,14,Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.~)
(John,11,15,And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.~)
(John,11,16,Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.~)
(John,11,17,Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.~)
(John,11,18,Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:~)
(John,11,19,And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.~)
(John,11,20,Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.~)
(John,11,21,Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.~)
(John,11,22,But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.~)
(John,11,23,Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.~)
(John,11,24,Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.~)
(John,11,25,Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:~)
(John,11,26,And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?~)
(John,11,27,She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.~)
(John,11,28,And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.~)
(John,11,29,As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.~)
(John,11,30,Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.~)
(John,11,31,The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.~)
(John,11,32,Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.~)
(John,11,33,When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.~)
(John,11,34,And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.~)
(John,11,35,Jesus wept.~)
(John,11,36,Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!~)
(John,11,37,And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?~)
(John,11,38,Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.~)
(John,11,39,Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.~)
(John,11,40,Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?~)
(John,11,41,Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.~)
(John,11,42,And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.~)
(John,11,43,And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.~)
(John,11,44,And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.~)
(John,11,45,Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.~)
(John,11,46,But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.~)
(John,11,47,Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.~)
(John,11,48,If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.~)
(John,11,49,And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,~)
(John,11,50,Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.~)
(John,11,51,And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;~)
(John,11,52,And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.~)
(John,11,53,Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.~)
(John,11,54,Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.~)
(John,11,55,And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.~)
(John,11,56,Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?~)
(John,11,57,Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.~)
(John,12,1,Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.~)
(John,12,2,There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.~)
(John,12,3,Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.~)
(John,12,4,Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,~)
(John,12,5,Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?~)
(John,12,6,This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.~)
(John,12,7,Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.~)
(John,12,8,For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.~)
(John,12,9,Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.~)
(John,12,10,But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;~)
(John,12,11,Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.~)
(John,12,12,On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,~)
(John,12,13,Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.~)
(John,12,14,And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,~)
(John,12,15,Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.~)
(John,12,16,These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.~)
(John,12,17,The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.~)
(John,12,18,For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.~)
(John,12,19,The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.~)
(John,12,20,And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:~)
(John,12,21,The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.~)
(John,12,22,Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.~)
(John,12,23,And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.~)
(John,12,24,Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.~)
(John,12,25,He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.~)
(John,12,26,If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.~)
(John,12,27,Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.~)
(John,12,28,Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.~)
(John,12,29,The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.~)
(John,12,30,Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.~)
(John,12,31,Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.~)
(John,12,32,And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.~)
(John,12,33,This he said, signifying what death he should die.~)
(John,12,34,The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?~)
(John,12,35,Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.~)
(John,12,36,While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.~)
(John,12,37,But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:~)
(John,12,38,That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?~)
(John,12,39,Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,~)
(John,12,40,He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.~)
(John,12,41,These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.~)
(John,12,42,Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:~)
(John,12,43,For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.~)
(John,12,44,Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.~)
(John,12,45,And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.~)
(John,12,46,I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.~)
(John,12,47,And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.~)
(John,12,48,He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.~)
(John,12,49,For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.~)
(John,12,50,And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.~)
(John,13,1,Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.~)
(John,13,2,And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;~)
(John,13,3,Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;~)
(John,13,4,He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.~)
(John,13,5,After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.~)
(John,13,6,Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?~)
(John,13,7,Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.~)
(John,13,8,Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.~)
(John,13,9,Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.~)
(John,13,10,Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.~)
(John,13,11,For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.~)
(John,13,12,So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?~)
(John,13,13,Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.~)
(John,13,14,If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.~)
(John,13,15,For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.~)
(John,13,16,Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.~)
(John,13,17,If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.~)
(John,13,18,I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.~)
(John,13,19,Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.~)
(John,13,20,Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.~)
(John,13,21,When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.~)
(John,13,22,Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.~)
(John,13,23,Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.~)
(John,13,24,Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.~)
(John,13,25,He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?~)
(John,13,26,Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.~)
(John,13,27,And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.~)
(John,13,28,Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.~)
(John,13,29,For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.~)
(John,13,30,He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.~)
(John,13,31,Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.~)
(John,13,32,If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.~)
(John,13,33,Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.~)
(John,13,34,A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.~)
(John,13,35,By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.~)
(John,13,36,Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.~)
(John,13,37,Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.~)
(John,13,38,Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.~)
(John,14,1,Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.~)
(John,14,2,In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.~)
(John,14,3,And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.~)
(John,14,4,And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.~)
(John,14,5,Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?~)
(John,14,6,Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.~)
(John,14,7,If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.~)
(John,14,8,Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.~)
(John,14,9,Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?~)
(John,14,10,Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.~)
(John,14,11,Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.~)
(John,14,12,Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.~)
(John,14,13,And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.~)
(John,14,14,If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.~)
(John,14,15,If ye love me, keep my commandments.~)
(John,14,16,And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;~)
(John,14,17,Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.~)
(John,14,18,I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.~)
(John,14,19,Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.~)
(John,14,20,At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.~)
(John,14,21,He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.~)
(John,14,22,Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?~)
(John,14,23,Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.~)
(John,14,24,He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.~)
(John,14,25,These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.~)
(John,14,26,But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.~)
(John,14,27,Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.~)
(John,14,28,Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.~)
(John,14,29,And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.~)
(John,14,30,Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.~)
(John,14,31,But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.~)
(John,15,1,I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.~)
(John,15,2,Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.~)
(John,15,3,Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.~)
(John,15,4,Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.~)
(John,15,5,I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.~)
(John,15,6,If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.~)
(John,15,7,If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.~)
(John,15,8,Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.~)
(John,15,9,As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.~)
(John,15,10,If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.~)
(John,15,11,These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.~)
(John,15,12,This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.~)
(John,15,13,Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.~)
(John,15,14,Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.~)
(John,15,15,Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.~)
(John,15,16,Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.~)
(John,15,17,These things I command you, that ye love one another.~)
(John,15,18,If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.~)
(John,15,19,If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.~)
(John,15,20,Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.~)
(John,15,21,But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.~)
(John,15,22,If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.~)
(John,15,23,He that hateth me hateth my Father also.~)
(John,15,24,If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.~)
(John,15,25,But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.~)
(John,15,26,But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:~)
(John,15,27,And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.~)
(John,16,1,These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.~)
(John,16,2,They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.~)
(John,16,3,And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.~)
(John,16,4,But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.~)
(John,16,5,But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?~)
(John,16,6,But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.~)
(John,16,7,Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.~)
(John,16,8,And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:~)
(John,16,9,Of sin, because they believe not on me;~)
(John,16,10,Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;~)
(John,16,11,Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.~)
(John,16,12,I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.~)
(John,16,13,Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.~)
(John,16,14,He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.~)
(John,16,15,All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.~)
(John,16,16,A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.~)
(John,16,17,Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?~)
(John,16,18,They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.~)
(John,16,19,Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?~)
(John,16,20,Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.~)
(John,16,21,A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.~)
(John,16,22,And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.~)
(John,16,23,And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.~)
(John,16,24,Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.~)
(John,16,25,These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.~)
(John,16,26,At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:~)
(John,16,27,For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.~)
(John,16,28,I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.~)
(John,16,29,His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.~)
(John,16,30,Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.~)
(John,16,31,Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?~)
(John,16,32,Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.~)
(John,16,33,These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.~)
(John,17,1,These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:~)
(John,17,2,As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.~)
(John,17,3,And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.~)
(John,17,4,I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.~)
(John,17,5,And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.~)
(John,17,6,I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.~)
(John,17,7,Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.~)
(John,17,8,For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.~)
(John,17,9,I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.~)
(John,17,10,And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.~)
(John,17,11,And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.~)
(John,17,12,While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.~)
(John,17,13,And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.~)
(John,17,14,I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.~)
(John,17,15,I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.~)
(John,17,16,They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.~)
(John,17,17,Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.~)
(John,17,18,As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.~)
(John,17,19,And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.~)
(John,17,20,Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;~)
(John,17,21,That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.~)
(John,17,22,And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:~)
(John,17,23,I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.~)
(John,17,24,Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.~)
(John,17,25,O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.~)
(John,17,26,And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.~)
(John,18,1,When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.~)
(John,18,2,And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.~)
(John,18,3,Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.~)
(John,18,4,Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?~)
(John,18,5,They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.~)
(John,18,6,As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.~)
(John,18,7,Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.~)
(John,18,8,Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:~)
(John,18,9,That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.~)
(John,18,10,Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.~)
(John,18,11,Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?~)
(John,18,12,Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,~)
(John,18,13,And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.~)
(John,18,14,Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.~)
(John,18,15,And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.~)
(John,18,16,But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.~)
(John,18,17,Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.~)
(John,18,18,And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.~)
(John,18,19,The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.~)
(John,18,20,Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.~)
(John,18,21,Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.~)
(John,18,22,And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?~)
(John,18,23,Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?~)
(John,18,24,Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.~)
(John,18,25,And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.~)
(John,18,26,One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?~)
(John,18,27,Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.~)
(John,18,28,Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.~)
(John,18,29,Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?~)
(John,18,30,They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.~)
(John,18,31,Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:~)
(John,18,32,That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.~)
(John,18,33,Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?~)
(John,18,34,Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?~)
(John,18,35,Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?~)
(John,18,36,Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.~)
(John,18,37,Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.~)
(John,18,38,Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.~)
(John,18,39,But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?~)
(John,18,40,Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.~)
(John,19,1,Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.~)
(John,19,2,And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,~)
(John,19,3,And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.~)
(John,19,4,Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.~)
(John,19,5,Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!~)
(John,19,6,When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.~)
(John,19,7,The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.~)
(John,19,8,When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;~)
(John,19,9,And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.~)
(John,19,10,Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?~)
(John,19,11,Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.~)
(John,19,12,And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.~)
(John,19,13,When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.~)
(John,19,14,And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!~)
(John,19,15,But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.~)
(John,19,16,Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.~)
(John,19,17,And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:~)
(John,19,18,Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.~)
(John,19,19,And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.~)
(John,19,20,This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.~)
(John,19,21,Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.~)
(John,19,22,Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.~)
(John,19,23,Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.~)
(John,19,24,They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.~)
(John,19,25,Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.~)
(John,19,26,When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!~)
(John,19,27,Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.~)
(John,19,28,After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.~)
(John,19,29,Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.~)
(John,19,30,When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.~)
(John,19,31,The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.~)
(John,19,32,Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.~)
(John,19,33,But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:~)
(John,19,34,But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.~)
(John,19,35,And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.~)
(John,19,36,For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.~)
(John,19,37,And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.~)
(John,19,38,And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.~)
(John,19,39,And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.~)
(John,19,40,Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.~)
(John,19,41,Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.~)
(John,19,42,There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.~)
(John,20,1,The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.~)
(John,20,2,Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.~)
(John,20,3,Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.~)
(John,20,4,So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.~)
(John,20,5,And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.~)
(John,20,6,Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,~)
(John,20,7,And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.~)
(John,20,8,Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.~)
(John,20,9,For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.~)
(John,20,10,Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.~)
(John,20,11,But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,~)
(John,20,12,And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.~)
(John,20,13,And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.~)
(John,20,14,And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.~)
(John,20,15,Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.~)
(John,20,16,Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.~)
(John,20,17,Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.~)

(Ezra,4,10,And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.~)
(Ezra,4,11,This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.~)
(Ezra,4,12,Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.~)
(Ezra,4,13,Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.~)
(Ezra,4,14,Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;~)
(Ezra,4,15,That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.~)
(Ezra,4,16,We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.~)
(Ezra,4,17,Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.~)
(Ezra,4,18,The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.~)
(Ezra,4,19,And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.~)
(Ezra,4,20,There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.~)
(Ezra,4,21,Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.~)
(Ezra,4,22,Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?~)
(Ezra,4,23,Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.~)
(Ezra,4,24,Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.~)
(Ezra,5,1,Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.~)
(Ezra,5,2,Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them.~)
(Ezra,5,3,At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?~)
(Ezra,5,4,Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?~)
(Ezra,5,5,But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.~)
(Ezra,5,6,The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:~)
(Ezra,5,7,They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace.~)
(Ezra,5,8,Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.~)
(Ezra,5,9,Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?~)
(Ezra,5,10,We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.~)
(Ezra,5,11,And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.~)
(Ezra,5,12,But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.~)
(Ezra,5,13,But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.~)
(Ezra,5,14,And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;~)
(Ezra,5,15,And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.~)
(Ezra,5,16,Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.~)
(Ezra,5,17,Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.~)
(Ezra,6,1,Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.~)
(Ezra,6,2,And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:~)
(Ezra,6,3,In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;~)
(Ezra,6,4,With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:~)
(Ezra,6,5,And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.~)
(Ezra,6,6,Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:~)
(Ezra,6,7,Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.~)
(Ezra,6,8,Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.~)
(Ezra,6,9,And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:~)
(Ezra,6,10,That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.~)
(Ezra,6,11,Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.~)
(Ezra,6,12,And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.~)
(Ezra,6,13,Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.~)
(Ezra,6,14,And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.~)
(Ezra,6,15,And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.~)
(Ezra,6,16,And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.~)
(Ezra,6,17,And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.~)
(Ezra,6,18,And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.~)
(Ezra,6,19,And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.~)
(Ezra,6,20,For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.~)
(Ezra,6,21,And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,~)
(Ezra,6,22,And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.~)
(Ezra,7,1,Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,~)
(Ezra,7,2,The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,~)
(Ezra,7,3,The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,~)
(Ezra,7,4,The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,~)
(Ezra,7,5,The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest:~)
(Ezra,7,6,This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.~)
(Ezra,7,7,And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.~)
(Ezra,7,8,And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.~)
(Ezra,7,9,For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.~)
(Ezra,7,10,For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.~)
(Ezra,7,11,Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.~)
(Ezra,7,12,Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.~)
(Ezra,7,13,I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.~)
(Ezra,7,14,Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;~)
(Ezra,7,15,And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,~)
(Ezra,7,16,And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem:~)
(Ezra,7,17,That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.~)
(Ezra,7,18,And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.~)
(Ezra,7,19,The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.~)
(Ezra,7,20,And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house.~)
(Ezra,7,21,And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,~)
(Ezra,7,22,Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.~)
(Ezra,7,23,Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?~)
(Ezra,7,24,Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.~)
(Ezra,7,25,And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.~)
(Ezra,7,26,And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.~)
(Ezra,7,27,Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem:~)
(Ezra,7,28,And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.~)
(Ezra,8,1,These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king.~)
(Ezra,8,2,Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.~)
(Ezra,8,3,Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.~)
(Ezra,8,4,Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.~)
(Ezra,8,5,Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.~)
(Ezra,8,6,Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.~)
(Ezra,8,7,And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.~)
(Ezra,8,8,And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males.~)
(Ezra,8,9,Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.~)
(Ezra,8,10,And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males.~)
(Ezra,8,11,And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males.~)
(Ezra,8,12,And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males.~)
(Ezra,8,13,And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.~)
(Ezra,8,14,Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.~)
(Ezra,8,15,And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.~)
(Ezra,8,16,Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.~)
(Ezra,8,17,And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.~)
(Ezra,8,18,And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;~)
(Ezra,8,19,And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;~)
(Ezra,8,20,Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.~)
(Ezra,8,21,Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.~)
(Ezra,8,22,For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.~)
(Ezra,8,23,So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.~)
(Ezra,8,24,Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,~)
(Ezra,8,25,And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:~)
(Ezra,8,26,I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents;~)
(Ezra,8,27,Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.~)
(Ezra,8,28,And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.~)
(Ezra,8,29,Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.~)
(Ezra,8,30,So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.~)
(Ezra,8,31,Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.~)
(Ezra,8,32,And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.~)
(Ezra,8,33,Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;~)
(Ezra,8,34,By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time.~)
(Ezra,8,35,Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.~)
(Ezra,8,36,And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God.~)
(Ezra,9,1,Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.~)
(Ezra,9,2,For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.~)
(Ezra,9,3,And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.~)
(Ezra,9,4,Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.~)
(Ezra,9,5,And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,~)
(Ezra,9,6,And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.~)
(Ezra,9,7,Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.~)
(Ezra,9,8,And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.~)
(Ezra,9,9,For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.~)
(Ezra,9,10,And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments,~)
(Ezra,9,11,Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.~)
(Ezra,9,12,Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.~)
(Ezra,9,13,And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;~)
(Ezra,9,14,Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?~)
(Ezra,9,15,O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.~)
(Ezra,10,1,Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.~)
(Ezra,10,2,And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.~)
(Ezra,10,3,Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.~)
(Ezra,10,4,Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.~)
(Ezra,10,5,Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.~)
(Ezra,10,6,Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.~)
(Ezra,10,7,And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem;~)
(Ezra,10,8,And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.~)
(Ezra,10,9,Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.~)
(Ezra,10,10,And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.~)
(Ezra,10,11,Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.~)
(Ezra,10,12,Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.~)
(Ezra,10,13,But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.~)
(Ezra,10,14,Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.~)
(Ezra,10,15,Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.~)
(Ezra,10,16,And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.~)
(Ezra,10,17,And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.~)
(Ezra,10,18,And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.~)
(Ezra,10,19,And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.~)
(Ezra,10,20,And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.~)
(Ezra,10,21,And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and Uzziah.~)
(Ezra,10,22,And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.~)
(Ezra,10,23,Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.~)
(Ezra,10,24,Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem, and Uri.~)
(Ezra,10,25,Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.~)
(Ezra,10,26,And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.~)
(Ezra,10,27,And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.~)

(Nehemiah,1,3,And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.~)
(Nehemiah,1,4,And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,~)
(Nehemiah,1,5,And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:~)
(Nehemiah,1,6,Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.~)
(Nehemiah,1,7,We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.~)
(Nehemiah,1,8,Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:~)
(Nehemiah,1,9,But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.~)
(Nehemiah,1,10,Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.~)
(Nehemiah,1,11,O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.~)
(Nehemiah,2,1,And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.~)
(Nehemiah,2,2,Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,~)
(Nehemiah,2,3,And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?~)
(Nehemiah,2,4,Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.~)
(Nehemiah,2,5,And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.~)

(Nehemiah,2,9,Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.~)
(Nehemiah,2,10,When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.~)
(Nehemiah,2,11,So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.~)
(Nehemiah,2,12,And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.~)
(Nehemiah,2,13,And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.~)
(Nehemiah,2,14,Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.~)
(Nehemiah,2,15,Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.~)
(Nehemiah,2,16,And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.~)
(Nehemiah,2,17,Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.~)
(Nehemiah,2,18,Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.~)
(Nehemiah,2,19,But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?~)
(Nehemiah,2,20,Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.~)
(Nehemiah,3,1,Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.~)
(Nehemiah,3,2,And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.~)

(Nehemiah,4,1,But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.~)
(Nehemiah,4,2,And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice?  will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?~)
(Nehemiah,4,3,Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.~)
(Nehemiah,4,4,Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:~)
(Nehemiah,4,5,And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.~)
(Nehemiah,4,6,So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.~)
(Nehemiah,4,7,But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,~)
(Nehemiah,4,8,And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.~)
(Nehemiah,4,9,Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.~)
(Nehemiah,4,10,And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.~)
(Nehemiah,4,11,And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.~)
(Nehemiah,4,12,And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.~)
(Nehemiah,4,13,Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.~)
(Nehemiah,4,14,And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.~)
(Nehemiah,4,15,And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.~)
(Nehemiah,4,16,And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.~)
(Nehemiah,4,17,They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.~)
(Nehemiah,4,18,For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.~)
(Nehemiah,4,19,And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.~)
(Nehemiah,4,20,In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.~)
(Nehemiah,4,21,So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.~)
(Nehemiah,4,22,Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.~)
(Nehemiah,4,23,So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.~)
(Nehemiah,5,1,And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.~)
(Nehemiah,5,2,For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.~)
(Nehemiah,5,3,Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.~)
(Nehemiah,5,4,There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.~)
(Nehemiah,5,5,Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.~)
(Nehemiah,5,6,And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.~)
(Nehemiah,5,7,Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.~)
(Nehemiah,5,8,And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.~)
(Nehemiah,5,9,Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?~)
(Nehemiah,5,10,I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.~)
(Nehemiah,5,11,Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.~)
(Nehemiah,5,12,Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.~)
(Nehemiah,5,13,Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.~)
(Nehemiah,5,14,Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.~)
(Nehemiah,5,15,But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.~)
(Nehemiah,5,16,Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.~)
(Nehemiah,5,17,Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.~)
(Nehemiah,5,18,Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.~)
(Nehemiah,5,19,Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.~)
(Nehemiah,6,1,Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)~)
(Nehemiah,6,2,That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.~)
(Nehemiah,6,3,And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?~)
(Nehemiah,6,4,Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.~)
(Nehemiah,6,5,Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;~)
(Nehemiah,6,6,Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.~)
(Nehemiah,6,7,And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.~)
(Nehemiah,6,8,Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.~)
(Nehemiah,6,9,For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.~)
(Nehemiah,6,10,Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.~)
(Nehemiah,6,11,And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.~)
(Nehemiah,6,12,And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.~)
(Nehemiah,6,13,Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.~)
(Nehemiah,6,14,My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.~)
(Nehemiah,6,15,So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.~)
(Nehemiah,6,16,And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.~)
(Nehemiah,6,17,Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.~)
(Nehemiah,6,18,For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.~)
(Nehemiah,6,19,Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.~)
(Nehemiah,7,1,Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,~)
(Nehemiah,7,2,That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.~)
(Nehemiah,7,3,And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.~)
(Nehemiah,7,4,Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.~)
(Nehemiah,7,5,And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein,~)
(Nehemiah,7,6,These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;~)
(Nehemiah,7,7,Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;~)

(Nehemiah,9,20,Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.~)

(Nehemiah,9,23,Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.~)
(Nehemiah,9,24,So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.~)
(Nehemiah,9,25,And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.~)
(Nehemiah,9,26,Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.~)
(Nehemiah,9,27,Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.~)
(Nehemiah,9,28,But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;~)
(Nehemiah,9,29,And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.~)
(Nehemiah,9,30,Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.~)
(Nehemiah,9,31,Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.~)
(Nehemiah,9,32,Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.~)
(Nehemiah,9,33,Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:~)
(Nehemiah,9,34,Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.~)
(Nehemiah,9,35,For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.~)
(Nehemiah,9,36,Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:~)
(Nehemiah,9,37,And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.~)

(Nehemiah,12,22,The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian.~)
(Nehemiah,12,23,The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.~)
(Nehemiah,12,24,And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.~)
(Nehemiah,12,25,Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.~)
(Nehemiah,12,26,These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.~)
(Nehemiah,12,27,And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.~)
(Nehemiah,12,28,And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;~)
(Nehemiah,12,29,Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.~)
(Nehemiah,12,30,And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.~)
(Nehemiah,12,31,Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:~)
(Nehemiah,12,32,And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,~)
(Nehemiah,12,33,And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,~)
(Nehemiah,12,34,Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,~)
(Nehemiah,12,35,And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:~)
(Nehemiah,12,36,And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.~)
(Nehemiah,12,37,And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.~)
(Nehemiah,12,38,And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;~)
(Nehemiah,12,39,And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.~)
(Nehemiah,12,40,So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:~)
(Nehemiah,12,41,And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;~)
(Nehemiah,12,42,And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.~)
(Nehemiah,12,43,Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.~)
(Nehemiah,12,44,And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.~)
(Nehemiah,12,45,And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.~)
(Nehemiah,12,46,For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.~)
(Nehemiah,12,47,And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.~)
(Nehemiah,13,1,On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;~)
(Nehemiah,13,2,Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.~)
(Nehemiah,13,3,Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.~)
(Nehemiah,13,4,And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:~)
(Nehemiah,13,5,And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.~)
(Nehemiah,13,6,But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:~)
(Nehemiah,13,7,And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.~)
(Nehemiah,13,8,And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.~)
(Nehemiah,13,9,Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.~)
(Nehemiah,13,10,And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.~)
(Nehemiah,13,11,Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.~)
(Nehemiah,13,12,Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.~)
(Nehemiah,13,13,And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.~)
(Nehemiah,13,14,Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.~)
(Nehemiah,13,15,In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.~)
(Nehemiah,13,16,There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.~)
(Nehemiah,13,17,Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?~)
(Nehemiah,13,18,Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.~)
(Nehemiah,13,19,And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.~)
(Nehemiah,13,20,So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.~)
(Nehemiah,13,21,Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.~)
(Nehemiah,13,22,And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.~)
(Nehemiah,13,23,In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:~)
(Nehemiah,13,24,And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.~)
(Nehemiah,13,25,And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.~)
(Nehemiah,13,26,Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.~)
(Nehemiah,13,27,Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?~)
(Nehemiah,13,28,And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.~)
(Nehemiah,13,29,Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.~)
(Nehemiah,13,30,Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;~)
(Nehemiah,13,31,And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.~)
(Philippians,1,1,Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:~)
(Philippians,1,2,Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Philippians,1,3,I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,~)
(Philippians,1,4,Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,~)
(Philippians,1,5,For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;~)
(Philippians,1,6,Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:~)
(Philippians,1,7,Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.~)
(Philippians,1,8,For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.~)
(Philippians,1,9,And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;~)
(Philippians,1,10,That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.~)
(Philippians,1,11,Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.~)
(Philippians,1,12,But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;~)
(Philippians,1,13,So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;~)
(Philippians,1,14,And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.~)
(Philippians,1,15,Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:~)
(Philippians,1,16,The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:~)
(Philippians,1,17,But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.~)
(Philippians,1,18,What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.~)
(Philippians,1,19,For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,~)
(Philippians,1,20,According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.~)
(Philippians,1,21,For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.~)
(Philippians,1,22,But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.~)
(Philippians,1,23,For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:~)
(Philippians,1,24,Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.~)
(Philippians,1,25,And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;~)
(Philippians,1,26,That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.~)
(Philippians,1,27,Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;~)
(Philippians,1,28,And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.~)
(Philippians,1,29,For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;~)
(Philippians,1,30,Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.~)
(Philippians,2,1,If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,~)
(Philippians,2,2,Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.~)
(Philippians,2,3,Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.~)
(Philippians,2,4,Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.~)
(Philippians,2,5,Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:~)
(Philippians,2,6,Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:~)
(Philippians,2,7,But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:~)
(Philippians,2,8,And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.~)
(Philippians,2,9,Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:~)
(Philippians,2,10,That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;~)
(Philippians,2,11,And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.~)
(Philippians,2,12,Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.~)
(Philippians,2,13,For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.~)
(Philippians,2,14,Do all things without murmurings and disputings:~)
(Philippians,2,15,That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;~)
(Philippians,2,16,Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.~)
(Philippians,2,17,Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.~)
(Philippians,2,18,For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.~)
(Philippians,2,19,But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.~)
(Philippians,2,20,For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.~)
(Philippians,2,21,For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.~)
(Philippians,2,22,But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.~)
(Philippians,2,23,Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.~)
(Philippians,2,24,But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.~)
(Philippians,2,25,Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.~)
(Philippians,2,26,For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.~)
(Philippians,2,27,For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.~)
(Philippians,2,28,I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.~)
(Philippians,2,29,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:~)
(Philippians,2,30,Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.~)
(Philippians,3,1,Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.~)
(Philippians,3,2,Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.~)
(Philippians,3,3,For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.~)
(Philippians,3,4,Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:~)
(Philippians,3,5,Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;~)
(Philippians,3,6,Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.~)
(Philippians,3,7,But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.~)
(Philippians,3,8,Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,~)
(Philippians,3,9,And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:~)
(Philippians,3,10,That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;~)
(Philippians,3,11,If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.~)
(Philippians,3,12,Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.~)
(Philippians,3,13,Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,~)
(Philippians,3,14,I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.~)
(Philippians,3,15,Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.~)
(Philippians,3,16,Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.~)
(Philippians,3,17,Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.~)
(Philippians,3,18,(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:~)
(Philippians,3,19,Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)~)
(Philippians,3,20,For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:~)
(Philippians,3,21,Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.~)
(Philippians,4,1,Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.~)
(Philippians,4,2,I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.~)
(Philippians,4,3,And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.~)
(Philippians,4,4,Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.~)
(Philippians,4,5,Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.~)
(Philippians,4,6,Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.~)
(Philippians,4,7,And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.~)
(Philippians,4,8,Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.~)
(Philippians,4,9,Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.~)
(Philippians,4,10,But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.~)
(Philippians,4,11,Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.~)
(Philippians,4,12,I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.~)
(Philippians,4,13,I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.~)
(Philippians,4,14,Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.~)
(Philippians,4,15,Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.~)
(Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.~)
(Philippians,4,17,Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.~)
(Philippians,4,18,But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.~)
(Philippians,4,19,But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.~)
(Philippians,4,20,Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.~)
(Philippians,4,21,Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.~)
(Philippians,4,22,All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.~)
(Philippians,4,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.~)
(Micah,1,1,The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.~)
(Micah,1,2,Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from his holy temple.~)
(Micah,1,3,For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.~)
(Micah,1,4,And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.~)
(Micah,1,5,For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?~)
(Micah,1,6,Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.~)
(Micah,1,7,And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.~)
(Micah,1,8,Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.~)

(Micah,2,2,And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.~)
(Micah,2,3,Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.~)
(Micah,2,4,In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.~)
(Micah,2,5,Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.~)
(Micah,2,6,Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.~)
(Micah,2,7,O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?~)
(Micah,2,8,Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.~)
(Micah,2,9,The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.~)
(Micah,2,10,Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.~)
(Micah,2,11,If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.~)
(Micah,2,12,I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.~)
(Micah,2,13,The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.~)

(Micah,4,3,And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.~)
(Micah,4,4,But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.~)

(Judges,3,13,And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.~)
(Judges,3,14,So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.~)
(Judges,3,15,But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.~)
(Judges,3,16,But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.~)
(Judges,3,17,And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.~)
(Judges,3,18,And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.~)

(Judges,3,20,And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.~)
(Judges,3,21,And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:~)
(Judges,3,22,And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.~)
(Judges,3,23,Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.~)
(Judges,3,24,When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.~)
(Judges,3,25,And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.~)
(Judges,3,26,And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.~)
(Judges,3,27,And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.~)
(Judges,3,28,And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.~)
(Judges,3,29,And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.~)
(Judges,3,30,So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.~)

(Judges,4,4,And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.~)
(Judges,4,5,And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.~)
(Judges,4,6,And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?~)
(Judges,4,7,And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand.~)
(Judges,4,8,And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.~)
(Judges,4,9,And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.~)
(Judges,4,10,And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.~)

(Judges,4,12,And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.~)
(Judges,4,13,And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.~)
(Judges,4,14,And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.~)
(Judges,4,15,And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.~)
(Judges,4,16,But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.~)
(Judges,4,17,Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.~)
(Judges,4,18,And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.~)
(Judges,4,19,And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.~)
(Judges,4,20,Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.~)
(Judges,4,21,Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.~)
(Judges,4,22,And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.~)
(Judges,4,23,So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.~)
(Judges,4,24,And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.~)
(Judges,5,1,Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,~)
(Judges,5,2,Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.~)
(Judges,5,3,Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.~)
(Judges,5,4,LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.~)
(Judges,5,5,The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.~)
(Judges,5,6,In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.~)

(Judges,5,8,They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?~)
(Judges,5,9,My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.~)
(Judges,5,10,Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.~)
(Judges,5,11,They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.~)
(Judges,5,12,Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.~)
(Judges,5,13,Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.~)
(Judges,5,14,Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.~)
(Judges,5,15,And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.~)
(Judges,5,16,Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.~)
(Judges,5,17,Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.~)
(Judges,5,18,Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.~)
(Judges,5,19,The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.~)
(Judges,5,20,They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.~)
(Judges,5,21,The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.~)
(Judges,5,22,Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.~)
(Judges,5,23,Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.~)
(Judges,5,24,Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.~)
(Judges,5,25,He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.~)
(Judges,5,26,She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.~)
(Judges,5,27,At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.~)
(Judges,5,28,The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?~)
(Judges,5,29,Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,~)
(Judges,5,30,Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?~)
(Judges,5,31,So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.~)
(Judges,6,1,And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.~)
(Judges,6,2,And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.~)
(Judges,6,3,And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;~)
(Judges,6,4,And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.~)

(Judges,6,6,And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.~)
(Judges,6,7,And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites,~)
(Judges,6,8,That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;~)

(Judges,6,11,And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.~)
(Judges,6,12,And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.~)
(Judges,6,13,And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.~)
(Judges,6,14,And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?~)
(Judges,6,15,And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.~)
(Judges,6,16,And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.~)
(Judges,6,17,And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.~)
(Judges,6,18,Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.~)
(Judges,6,19,And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.~)
(Judges,6,20,And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.~)
(Judges,6,21,Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.~)
(Judges,6,22,And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.~)
(Judges,6,23,And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.~)
(Judges,6,24,Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.~)
(Judges,6,25,And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:~)
(Judges,6,26,And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.~)
(Judges,6,27,Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.~)
(Judges,6,28,And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.~)
(Judges,6,29,And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.~)
(Judges,6,30,Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.~)
(Judges,6,31,And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.~)
(Judges,6,32,Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.~)
(Judges,6,33,Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.~)
(Judges,6,34,But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.~)
(Judges,6,35,And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.~)
(Judges,6,36,And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,~)
(Judges,6,37,Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.~)
(Judges,6,38,And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.~)
(Judges,6,39,And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.~)
(Judges,6,40,And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.~)
(Judges,7,1,Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.~)
(Judges,7,2,And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.~)
(Judges,7,3,Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.~)
(Judges,7,4,And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.~)
(Judges,7,5,So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.~)
(Judges,7,6,And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.~)
(Judges,7,7,And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.~)
(Judges,7,8,So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.~)
(Judges,7,9,And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.~)
(Judges,7,10,But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:~)
(Judges,7,11,And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.~)
(Judges,7,12,And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.~)
(Judges,7,13,And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.~)
(Judges,7,14,And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.~)
(Judges,7,15,And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.~)
(Judges,7,16,And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.~)
(Judges,7,17,And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.~)
(Judges,7,18,When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.~)
(Judges,7,19,So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.~)
(Judges,7,20,And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.~)
(Judges,7,21,And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.~)
(Judges,7,22,And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.~)
(Judges,7,23,And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.~)
(Judges,7,24,And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.~)
(Judges,7,25,And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.~)
(Judges,8,1,And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.~)
(Judges,8,2,And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?~)
(Judges,8,3,God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.~)
(Judges,8,4,And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.~)
(Judges,8,5,And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.~)
(Judges,8,6,And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?~)
(Judges,8,7,And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.~)
(Judges,8,8,And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.~)
(Judges,8,9,And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.~)
(Judges,8,10,Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.~)
(Judges,8,11,And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.~)
(Judges,8,12,And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.~)
(Judges,8,13,And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up,~)
(Judges,8,14,And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.~)
(Judges,8,15,And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?~)
(Judges,8,16,And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.~)
(Judges,8,17,And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.~)
(Judges,8,18,Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.~)
(Judges,8,19,And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.~)
(Judges,8,20,And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.~)
(Judges,8,21,Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.~)
(Judges,8,22,Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.~)
(Judges,8,23,And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.~)
(Judges,8,24,And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)~)
(Judges,8,25,And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.~)
(Judges,8,26,And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks.~)
(Judges,8,27,And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.~)
(Judges,8,28,Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.~)
(Judges,8,29,And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.~)
(Judges,8,30,And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.~)
(Judges,8,31,And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.~)
(Judges,8,32,And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.~)
(Judges,8,33,And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.~)
(Judges,8,34,And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:~)
(Judges,8,35,Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.~)
(Judges,9,1,And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying,~)
(Judges,9,2,Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.~)
(Judges,9,3,And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.~)
(Judges,9,4,And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.~)
(Judges,9,5,And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.~)
(Judges,9,6,And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.~)
(Judges,9,7,And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.~)
(Judges,9,8,The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.~)
(Judges,9,9,But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?~)
(Judges,9,10,And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.~)
(Judges,9,11,But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?~)
(Judges,9,12,Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.~)
(Judges,9,13,And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?~)
(Judges,9,14,Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.~)
(Judges,9,15,And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.~)
(Judges,9,16,Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;~)
(Judges,9,17,(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:~)
(Judges,9,18,And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)~)
(Judges,9,19,If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:~)
(Judges,9,20,But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.~)
(Judges,9,21,And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.~)
(Judges,9,22,When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,~)
(Judges,9,23,Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:~)
(Judges,9,24,That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren.~)
(Judges,9,25,And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.~)
(Judges,9,26,And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.~)
(Judges,9,27,And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.~)
(Judges,9,28,And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?~)
(Judges,9,29,And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.~)
(Judges,9,30,And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.~)
(Judges,9,31,And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.~)
(Judges,9,32,Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field:~)
(Judges,9,33,And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.~)
(Judges,9,34,And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.~)
(Judges,9,35,And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.~)
(Judges,9,36,And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.~)
(Judges,9,37,And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.~)
(Judges,9,38,Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.~)
(Judges,9,39,And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.~)
(Judges,9,40,And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.~)
(Judges,9,41,And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.~)
(Judges,9,42,And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.~)
(Judges,9,43,And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.~)
(Judges,9,44,And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.~)
(Judges,9,45,And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.~)
(Judges,9,46,And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.~)
(Judges,9,47,And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.~)
(Judges,9,48,And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.~)
(Judges,9,49,And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.~)
(Judges,9,50,Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.~)
(Judges,9,51,But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.~)
(Judges,9,52,And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.~)
(Judges,9,53,And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.~)
(Judges,9,54,Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.~)
(Judges,9,55,And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.~)
(Judges,9,56,Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:~)
(Judges,9,57,And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.~)
(Judges,10,1,And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim.~)
(Judges,10,2,And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.~)
(Judges,10,3,And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.~)
(Judges,10,4,And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.~)
(Judges,10,5,And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.~)
(Judges,10,6,And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.~)
(Judges,10,7,And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.~)
(Judges,10,8,And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.~)
(Judges,10,9,Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.~)
(Judges,10,10,And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.~)
(Judges,10,11,And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?~)
(Judges,10,12,The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.~)
(Judges,10,13,Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more.~)
(Judges,10,14,Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation.~)
(Judges,10,15,And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.~)
(Judges,10,16,And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.~)
(Judges,10,17,Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.~)
(Judges,10,18,And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.~)
(Judges,11,1,Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.~)
(Judges,11,2,And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.~)
(Judges,11,3,Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.~)
(Judges,11,4,And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.~)
(Judges,11,5,And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:~)
(Judges,11,6,And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.~)
(Judges,11,7,And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?~)
(Judges,11,8,And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.~)
(Judges,11,9,And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?~)
(Judges,11,10,And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.~)
(Judges,11,11,Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.~)
(Judges,11,12,And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?~)
(Judges,11,13,And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.~)
(Judges,11,14,And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon:~)
(Judges,11,15,And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:~)
(Judges,11,16,But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;~)
(Judges,11,17,Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.~)
(Judges,11,18,Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.~)
(Judges,11,19,And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.~)
(Judges,11,20,But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.~)
(Judges,11,21,And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.~)
(Judges,11,22,And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.~)
(Judges,11,23,So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?~)
(Judges,11,24,Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.~)
(Judges,11,25,And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them,~)
(Judges,11,26,While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time?~)
(Judges,11,27,Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.~)
(Judges,11,28,Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.~)
(Judges,11,29,Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.~)
(Judges,11,30,And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,~)
(Judges,11,31,Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.~)
(Judges,11,32,So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.~)
(Judges,11,33,And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.~)
(Judges,11,34,And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.~)
(Judges,11,35,And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.~)
(Judges,11,36,And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.~)
(Judges,11,37,And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.~)
(Judges,11,38,And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.~)
(Judges,11,39,And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,~)
(Judges,11,40,That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.~)
(Judges,12,1,And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.~)
(Judges,12,2,And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.~)
(Judges,12,3,And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?~)
(Judges,12,4,Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.~)
(Judges,12,5,And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;~)
(Judges,12,6,Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.~)
(Judges,12,7,And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.~)
(Judges,12,8,And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.~)
(Judges,12,9,And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.~)
(Judges,12,10,Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.~)
(Judges,12,11,And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.~)
(Judges,12,12,And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.~)
(Judges,12,13,And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.~)
(Judges,12,14,And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.~)
(Judges,12,15,And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.~)
(Judges,13,1,And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.~)
(Judges,13,2,And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.~)
(Judges,13,3,And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.~)
(Judges,13,4,Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:~)
(Judges,13,5,For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.~)
(Judges,13,6,Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:~)
(Judges,13,7,But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.~)
(Judges,13,8,Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.~)
(Judges,13,9,And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.~)
(Judges,13,10,And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.~)
(Judges,13,11,And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.~)
(Judges,13,12,And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?~)
(Judges,13,13,And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.~)
(Judges,13,14,She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.~)
(Judges,13,15,And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.~)
(Judges,13,16,And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.~)
(Judges,13,17,And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?~)
(Judges,13,18,And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?~)
(Judges,13,19,So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.~)
(Judges,13,20,For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.~)
(Judges,13,21,But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.~)
(Judges,13,22,And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.~)
(Judges,13,23,But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.~)
(Judges,13,24,And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.~)
(Judges,13,25,And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.~)
(Judges,14,1,And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.~)
(Judges,14,2,And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.~)
(Judges,14,3,Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.~)
(Judges,14,4,But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.~)
(Judges,14,5,Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.~)
(Judges,14,6,And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.~)
(Judges,14,7,And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.~)
(Judges,14,8,And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.~)
(Judges,14,9,And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.~)
(Judges,14,10,So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.~)
(Judges,14,11,And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.~)
(Judges,14,12,And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:~)
(Judges,14,13,But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.~)
(Judges,14,14,And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.~)
(Judges,14,15,And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?~)
(Judges,14,16,And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?~)
(Judges,14,17,And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.~)
(Judges,14,18,And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.~)
(Judges,14,19,And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.~)
(Judges,14,20,But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.~)
(Judges,15,1,But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.~)
(Judges,15,2,And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.~)
(Judges,15,3,And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.~)
(Judges,15,4,And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.~)
(Judges,15,5,And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.~)
(Judges,15,6,Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.~)
(Judges,15,7,And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.~)
(Judges,15,8,And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.~)
(Judges,15,9,Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.~)
(Judges,15,10,And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.~)
(Judges,15,11,Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.~)
(Judges,15,12,And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.~)
(Judges,15,13,And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.~)
(Judges,15,14,And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.~)
(Judges,15,15,And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.~)
(Judges,15,16,And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.~)
(Judges,15,17,And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi.~)
(Judges,15,18,And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?~)
(Judges,15,19,But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.~)
(Judges,15,20,And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.~)
(Judges,16,1,Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.~)
(Judges,16,2,And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.~)
(Judges,16,3,And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.~)
(Judges,16,4,And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.~)
(Judges,16,5,And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.~)
(Judges,16,6,And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.~)
(Judges,16,7,And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.~)
(Judges,16,8,Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.~)
(Judges,16,9,Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.~)
(Judges,16,10,And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.~)
(Judges,16,11,And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.~)
(Judges,16,12,Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.~)
(Judges,16,13,And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.~)
(Judges,16,14,And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.~)
(Judges,16,15,And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.~)
(Judges,16,16,And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;~)
(Judges,16,17,That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.~)
(Judges,16,18,And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.~)
(Judges,16,19,And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.~)
(Judges,16,20,And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.~)
(Judges,16,21,But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.~)
(Judges,16,22,Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.~)
(Judges,16,23,Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.~)
(Judges,16,24,And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.~)
(Judges,16,25,And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.~)
(Judges,16,26,And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.~)
(Judges,16,27,Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.~)
(Judges,16,28,And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.~)
(Judges,16,29,And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.~)
(Judges,16,30,And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.~)
(Judges,16,31,Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.~)
(Judges,17,1,And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.~)
(Judges,17,2,And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.~)
(Judges,17,3,And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.~)
(Judges,17,4,Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.~)
(Judges,17,5,And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.~)
(Judges,17,6,In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.~)
(Judges,17,7,And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.~)
(Judges,17,8,And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.~)
(Judges,17,9,And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.~)
(Judges,17,10,And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.~)
(Judges,17,11,And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.~)
(Judges,17,12,And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.~)
(Judges,17,13,Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.~)
(Judges,18,1,In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.~)
(Judges,18,2,And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there.~)
(Judges,18,3,When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?~)
(Judges,18,4,And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.~)
(Judges,18,5,And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.~)
(Judges,18,6,And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go.~)
(Judges,18,7,Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man.~)
(Judges,18,8,And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?~)
(Judges,18,9,And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.~)
(Judges,18,10,When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.~)
(Judges,18,11,And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.~)
(Judges,18,12,And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.~)
(Judges,18,13,And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.~)
(Judges,18,14,Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.~)
(Judges,18,15,And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.~)
(Judges,18,16,And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.~)
(Judges,18,17,And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.~)
(Judges,18,18,And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?~)
(Judges,18,19,And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?~)
(Judges,18,20,And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.~)
(Judges,18,21,So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.~)
(Judges,18,22,And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.~)
(Judges,18,23,And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?~)
(Judges,18,24,And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?~)
(Judges,18,25,And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.~)
(Judges,18,26,And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.~)
(Judges,18,27,And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.~)
(Judges,18,28,And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.~)
(Judges,18,29,And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.~)
(Judges,18,30,And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.~)
(Judges,18,31,And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.~)
(Judges,19,1,And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.~)
(Judges,19,2,And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months.~)
(Judges,19,3,And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.~)
(Judges,19,4,And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.~)
(Judges,19,5,And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.~)
(Judges,19,6,And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.~)
(Judges,19,7,And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again.~)
(Judges,19,8,And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.~)
(Judges,19,9,And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.~)
(Judges,19,10,But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.~)
(Judges,19,11,And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.~)
(Judges,19,12,And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.~)
(Judges,19,13,And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.~)
(Judges,19,14,And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.~)
(Judges,19,15,And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.~)
(Judges,19,16,And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.~)
(Judges,19,17,And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?~)
(Judges,19,18,And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.~)
(Judges,19,19,Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.~)
(Judges,19,20,And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.~)
(Judges,19,21,So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.~)
(Judges,19,22,Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.~)
(Judges,19,23,And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.~)
(Judges,19,24,Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.~)
(Judges,19,25,But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.~)
(Judges,19,26,Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.~)
(Judges,19,27,And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold.~)
(Judges,19,28,And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.~)
(Judges,19,29,And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.~)
(Judges,19,30,And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.~)
(Judges,20,1,Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.~)
(Judges,20,2,And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.~)
(Judges,20,3,(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?~)
(Judges,20,4,And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.~)
(Judges,20,5,And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.~)
(Judges,20,6,And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.~)
(Judges,20,7,Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.~)
(Judges,20,8,And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.~)
(Judges,20,9,But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it;~)
(Judges,20,10,And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.~)
(Judges,20,11,So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.~)
(Judges,20,12,And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?~)
(Judges,20,13,Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.~)
(Judges,20,14,But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.~)
(Judges,20,15,And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.~)
(Judges,20,16,Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.~)
(Judges,20,17,And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.~)
(Judges,20,18,And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.~)
(Judges,20,19,And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.~)
(Judges,20,20,And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.~)
(Judges,20,21,And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men.~)
(Judges,20,22,And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day.~)
(Judges,20,23,(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)~)
(Judges,20,24,And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day.~)
(Judges,20,25,And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.~)
(Judges,20,26,Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.~)
(Judges,20,27,And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,~)
(Judges,20,28,And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.~)
(Judges,20,29,And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.~)
(Judges,20,30,And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.~)
(Judges,20,31,And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.~)
(Judges,20,32,And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.~)
(Judges,20,33,And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.~)
(Judges,20,34,And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them.~)
(Judges,20,35,And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.~)
(Judges,20,36,So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.~)
(Judges,20,37,And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.~)
(Judges,20,38,Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.~)
(Judges,20,39,And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.~)
(Judges,20,40,But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.~)

(Philemon,1,2,And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:~)
(Philemon,1,3,Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Philemon,1,4,I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,~)
(Philemon,1,5,Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;~)
(Philemon,1,6,That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.~)
(Philemon,1,7,For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.~)
(Philemon,1,8,Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,~)
(Philemon,1,9,Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.~)
(Philemon,1,10,I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:~)
(Philemon,1,11,Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:~)
(Philemon,1,12,Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:~)
(Philemon,1,13,Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:~)
(Philemon,1,14,But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.~)
(Philemon,1,15,For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;~)
(Philemon,1,16,Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?~)
(Philemon,1,17,If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.~)
(Philemon,1,18,If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;~)
(Philemon,1,19,I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.~)

(2 Peter,1,1,Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:~)
(2 Peter,1,2,Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,~)
(2 Peter,1,3,According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:~)
(2 Peter,1,4,Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.~)
(2 Peter,1,5,And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;~)
(2 Peter,1,6,And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;~)
(2 Peter,1,7,And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.~)
(2 Peter,1,8,For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(2 Peter,1,9,But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.~)
(2 Peter,1,10,Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:~)
(2 Peter,1,11,For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.~)
(2 Peter,1,12,Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.~)
(2 Peter,1,13,Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;~)
(2 Peter,1,14,Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.~)
(2 Peter,1,15,Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.~)
(2 Peter,1,16,For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.~)
(2 Peter,1,17,For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.~)
(2 Peter,1,18,And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.~)
(2 Peter,1,19,We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:~)
(2 Peter,1,20,Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.~)
(2 Peter,1,21,For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.~)
(2 Peter,2,1,But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.~)
(2 Peter,2,2,And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.~)
(2 Peter,2,3,And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.~)
(2 Peter,2,4,For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;~)
(2 Peter,2,5,And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;~)
(2 Peter,2,6,And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;~)
(2 Peter,2,7,And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:~)
(2 Peter,2,8,(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)~)
(2 Peter,2,9,The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:~)
(2 Peter,2,10,But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.~)
(2 Peter,2,11,Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.~)
(2 Peter,2,12,But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;~)
(2 Peter,2,13,And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;~)
(2 Peter,2,14,Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:~)
(2 Peter,2,15,Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;~)
(2 Peter,2,16,But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.~)
(2 Peter,2,17,These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.~)
(2 Peter,2,18,For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.~)
(2 Peter,2,19,While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.~)
(2 Peter,2,20,For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.~)
(2 Peter,2,21,For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.~)
(2 Peter,2,22,But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.~)
(2 Peter,3,1,This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:~)
(2 Peter,3,2,That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:~)
(2 Peter,3,3,Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,~)
(2 Peter,3,4,And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.~)
(2 Peter,3,5,For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:~)
(2 Peter,3,6,Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:~)
(2 Peter,3,7,But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.~)
(2 Peter,3,8,But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.~)
(2 Peter,3,9,The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.~)
(2 Peter,3,10,But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.~)
(2 Peter,3,11,Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,~)
(2 Peter,3,12,Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?~)
(2 Peter,3,13,Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.~)
(2 Peter,3,14,Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.~)
(2 Peter,3,15,And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;~)
(2 Peter,3,16,As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.~)
(2 Peter,3,17,Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.~)
(2 Peter,3,18,But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.~)
(Ephesians,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:~)
(Ephesians,1,2,Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Ephesians,1,3,Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:~)
(Ephesians,1,4,According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:~)
(Ephesians,1,5,Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,~)
(Ephesians,1,6,To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.~)
(Ephesians,1,7,In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;~)
(Ephesians,1,8,Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;~)
(Ephesians,1,9,Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:~)
(Ephesians,1,10,That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:~)
(Ephesians,1,11,In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:~)
(Ephesians,1,12,That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.~)
(Ephesians,1,13,In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,~)
(Ephesians,1,14,Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.~)
(Ephesians,1,15,Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,~)
(Ephesians,1,16,Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;~)
(Ephesians,1,17,That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:~)
(Ephesians,1,18,The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,~)
(Ephesians,1,19,And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,~)
(Ephesians,1,20,Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,~)
(Ephesians,1,21,Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:~)
(Ephesians,1,22,And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,~)
(Ephesians,1,23,Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.~)
(Ephesians,2,1,And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;~)
(Ephesians,2,2,Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:~)
(Ephesians,2,3,Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.~)
(Ephesians,2,4,But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,~)
(Ephesians,2,5,Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)~)
(Ephesians,2,6,And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:~)
(Ephesians,2,7,That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.~)
(Ephesians,2,8,For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:~)
(Ephesians,2,9,Not of works, lest any man should boast.~)
(Ephesians,2,10,For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.~)
(Ephesians,2,11,Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;~)
(Ephesians,2,12,That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:~)
(Ephesians,2,13,But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.~)
(Ephesians,2,14,For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;~)
(Ephesians,2,15,Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;~)
(Ephesians,2,16,And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:~)
(Ephesians,2,17,And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.~)
(Ephesians,2,18,For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.~)
(Ephesians,2,19,Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;~)
(Ephesians,2,20,And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;~)
(Ephesians,2,21,In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:~)
(Ephesians,2,22,In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.~)
(Ephesians,3,1,For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,~)
(Ephesians,3,2,If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:~)
(Ephesians,3,3,How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,~)
(Ephesians,3,4,Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)~)
(Ephesians,3,5,Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;~)
(Ephesians,3,6,That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:~)
(Ephesians,3,7,Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.~)
(Ephesians,3,8,Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;~)
(Ephesians,3,9,And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:~)
(Ephesians,3,10,To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,~)
(Ephesians,3,11,According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:~)
(Ephesians,3,12,In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.~)
(Ephesians,3,13,Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.~)
(Ephesians,3,14,For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,~)
(Ephesians,3,15,Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,~)
(Ephesians,3,16,That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;~)
(Ephesians,3,17,That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,~)
(Ephesians,3,18,May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;~)
(Ephesians,3,19,And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.~)
(Ephesians,3,20,Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,~)
(Ephesians,3,21,Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.~)
(Ephesians,4,1,I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,~)
(Ephesians,4,2,With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;~)
(Ephesians,4,3,Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.~)
(Ephesians,4,4,There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;~)
(Ephesians,4,5,One Lord, one faith, one baptism,~)
(Ephesians,4,6,One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.~)
(Ephesians,4,7,But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.~)
(Ephesians,4,8,Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.~)
(Ephesians,4,9,(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?~)
(Ephesians,4,10,He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)~)
(Ephesians,4,11,And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;~)
(Ephesians,4,12,For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:~)
(Ephesians,4,13,Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:~)
(Ephesians,4,14,That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;~)
(Ephesians,4,15,But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:~)
(Ephesians,4,16,From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.~)
(Ephesians,4,17,This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,~)
(Ephesians,4,18,Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:~)
(Ephesians,4,19,Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.~)
(Ephesians,4,20,But ye have not so learned Christ;~)
(Ephesians,4,21,If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:~)
(Ephesians,4,22,That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;~)
(Ephesians,4,23,And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;~)
(Ephesians,4,24,And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.~)
(Ephesians,4,25,Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.~)
(Ephesians,4,26,Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:~)
(Ephesians,4,27,Neither give place to the devil.~)
(Ephesians,4,28,Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.~)
(Ephesians,4,29,Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.~)
(Ephesians,4,30,And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.~)
(Ephesians,4,31,Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:~)
(Ephesians,4,32,And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.~)
(Ephesians,5,1,Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;~)
(Ephesians,5,2,And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.~)
(Ephesians,5,3,But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;~)
(Ephesians,5,4,Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.~)
(Ephesians,5,5,For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.~)
(Ephesians,5,6,Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.~)
(Ephesians,5,7,Be not ye therefore partakers with them.~)
(Ephesians,5,8,For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:~)
(Ephesians,5,9,(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)~)
(Ephesians,5,10,Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.~)
(Ephesians,5,11,And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.~)
(Ephesians,5,12,For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.~)
(Ephesians,5,13,But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.~)
(Ephesians,5,14,Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.~)
(Ephesians,5,15,See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,~)
(Ephesians,5,16,Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.~)
(Ephesians,5,17,Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.~)
(Ephesians,5,18,And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;~)
(Ephesians,5,19,Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;~)
(Ephesians,5,20,Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;~)
(Ephesians,5,21,Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.~)
(Ephesians,5,22,Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.~)
(Ephesians,5,23,For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.~)
(Ephesians,5,24,Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.~)
(Ephesians,5,25,Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;~)
(Ephesians,5,26,That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,~)
(Ephesians,5,27,That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.~)
(Ephesians,5,28,So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.~)
(Ephesians,5,29,For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:~)
(Ephesians,5,30,For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.~)
(Ephesians,5,31,For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.~)
(Ephesians,5,32,This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.~)
(Ephesians,5,33,Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.~)
(Ephesians,6,1,Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.~)
(Ephesians,6,2,Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;~)
(Ephesians,6,3,That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.~)
(Ephesians,6,4,And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.~)
(Ephesians,6,5,Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;~)
(Ephesians,6,6,Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;~)
(Ephesians,6,7,With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:~)
(Ephesians,6,8,Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.~)
(Ephesians,6,9,And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.~)
(Ephesians,6,10,Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.~)
(Ephesians,6,11,Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.~)
(Ephesians,6,12,For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.~)
(Ephesians,6,13,Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.~)
(Ephesians,6,14,Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;~)
(Ephesians,6,15,And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;~)
(Ephesians,6,16,Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.~)
(Ephesians,6,17,And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:~)
(Ephesians,6,18,Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;~)
(Ephesians,6,19,And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,~)
(Ephesians,6,20,For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.~)
(Ephesians,6,21,But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:~)
(Ephesians,6,22,Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.~)
(Ephesians,6,23,Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Ephesians,6,24,Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.~)
(Job,1,1,There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.~)
(Job,1,2,And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.~)
(Job,1,3,His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.~)
(Job,1,4,And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.~)
(Job,1,5,And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.~)
(Job,1,6,Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.~)
(Job,1,7,And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.~)
(Job,1,8,And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?~)
(Job,1,9,Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?~)
(Job,1,10,Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.~)
(Job,1,11,But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.~)
(Job,1,12,And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.~)
(Job,1,13,And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:~)
(Job,1,14,And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:~)
(Job,1,15,And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~)
(Job,1,16,While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~)
(Job,1,17,While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~)
(Job,1,18,While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:~)
(Job,1,19,And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~)
(Job,1,20,Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,~)
(Job,1,21,And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.~)
(Job,1,22,In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.~)
(Job,2,1,Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.~)
(Job,2,2,And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.~)
(Job,2,3,And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.~)
(Job,2,4,And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.~)
(Job,2,5,But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.~)
(Job,2,6,And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.~)
(Job,2,7,So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.~)
(Job,2,8,And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.~)
(Job,2,9,Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  curse God, and die.~)
(Job,2,10,But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.~)
(Job,2,11,Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.~)
(Job,2,12,And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.~)
(Job,2,13,So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.~)
(Job,3,1,After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.~)
(Job,3,2,And Job spake, and said,~)
(Job,3,3,Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.~)
(Job,3,4,Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.~)
(Job,3,5,Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.~)
(Job,3,6,As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.~)
(Job,3,7,Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.~)
(Job,3,8,Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.~)
(Job,3,9,Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:~)
(Job,3,10,Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.~)
(Job,3,11,Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?~)
(Job,3,12,Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?~)
(Job,3,13,For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,~)
(Job,3,14,With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;~)
(Job,3,15,Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:~)
(Job,3,16,Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.~)
(Job,3,17,There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.~)
(Job,3,18,There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.~)
(Job,3,19,The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.~)
(Job,3,20,Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;~)
(Job,3,21,Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;~)
(Job,3,22,Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?~)
(Job,3,23,Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?~)
(Job,3,24,For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.~)
(Job,3,25,For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.~)
(Job,3,26,I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.~)
(Job,4,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,~)
(Job,4,2,If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?~)
(Job,4,3,Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.~)
(Job,4,4,Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.~)
(Job,4,5,But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.~)
(Job,4,6,Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?~)
(Job,4,7,Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?~)
(Job,4,8,Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.~)
(Job,4,9,By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.~)
(Job,4,10,The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.~)
(Job,4,11,The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.~)
(Job,4,12,Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.~)
(Job,4,13,In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,~)
(Job,4,14,Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.~)
(Job,4,15,Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:~)
(Job,4,16,It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,~)
(Job,4,17,Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?~)
(Job,4,18,Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:~)
(Job,4,19,How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?~)
(Job,4,20,They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.~)
(Job,4,21,Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.~)
(Job,5,1,Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?~)
(Job,5,2,For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.~)
(Job,5,3,I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.~)
(Job,5,4,His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.~)
(Job,5,5,Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.~)
(Job,5,6,Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;~)
(Job,5,7,Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.~)
(Job,5,8,I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:~)
(Job,5,9,Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:~)
(Job,5,10,Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:~)
(Job,5,11,To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.~)
(Job,5,12,He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.~)
(Job,5,13,He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.~)
(Job,5,14,They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.~)
(Job,5,15,But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.~)
(Job,5,16,So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.~)
(Job,5,17,Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:~)
(Job,5,18,For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.~)
(Job,5,19,He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.~)
(Job,5,20,In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.~)
(Job,5,21,Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.~)
(Job,5,22,At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.~)
(Job,5,23,For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.~)
(Job,5,24,And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.~)
(Job,5,25,Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.~)
(Job,5,26,Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.~)
(Job,5,27,Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.~)
(Job,6,1,But Job answered and said,~)
(Job,6,2,Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!~)
(Job,6,3,For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.~)
(Job,6,4,For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.~)
(Job,6,5,Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?~)
(Job,6,6,Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?~)
(Job,6,7,The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.~)
(Job,6,8,Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!~)
(Job,6,9,Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!~)
(Job,6,10,Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.~)
(Job,6,11,What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?~)
(Job,6,12,Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?~)
(Job,6,13,Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?~)
(Job,6,14,To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.~)
(Job,6,15,My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;~)
(Job,6,16,Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:~)
(Job,6,17,What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.~)
(Job,6,18,The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.~)
(Job,6,19,The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.~)
(Job,6,20,They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.~)
(Job,6,21,For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.~)
(Job,6,22,Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?~)
(Job,6,23,Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?~)
(Job,6,24,Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.~)
(Job,6,25,How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?~)
(Job,6,26,Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?~)
(Job,6,27,Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.~)
(Job,6,28,Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.~)
(Job,6,29,Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.~)
(Job,6,30,Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?~)
(Job,7,1,Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?~)
(Job,7,2,As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:~)
(Job,7,3,So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.~)
(Job,7,4,When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.~)
(Job,7,5,My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.~)
(Job,7,6,My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.~)
(Job,7,7,O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.~)
(Job,7,8,The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.~)
(Job,7,9,As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.~)
(Job,7,10,He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.~)
(Job,7,11,Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.~)
(Job,7,12,Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?~)
(Job,7,13,When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;~)
(Job,7,14,Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:~)
(Job,7,15,So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.~)
(Job,7,16,I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.~)
(Job,7,17,What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?~)
(Job,7,18,And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?~)
(Job,7,19,How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?~)
(Job,7,20,I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?~)
(Job,7,21,And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.~)
(Job,8,1,Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,~)
(Job,8,2,How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?~)
(Job,8,3,Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?~)
(Job,8,4,If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;~)
(Job,8,5,If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;~)
(Job,8,6,If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.~)
(Job,8,7,Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.~)
(Job,8,8,For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:~)
(Job,8,9,(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)~)
(Job,8,10,Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?~)
(Job,8,11,Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?~)
(Job,8,12,Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.~)
(Job,8,13,So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:~)
(Job,8,14,Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.~)
(Job,8,15,He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.~)
(Job,8,16,He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.~)
(Job,8,17,His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.~)
(Job,8,18,If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.~)
(Job,8,19,Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.~)
(Job,8,20,Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:~)
(Job,8,21,Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.~)
(Job,8,22,They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.~)
(Job,9,1,Then Job answered and said,~)
(Job,9,2,I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?~)
(Job,9,3,If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.~)
(Job,9,4,He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?~)
(Job,9,5,Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.~)
(Job,9,6,Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.~)
(Job,9,7,Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.~)
(Job,9,8,Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.~)
(Job,9,9,Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.~)
(Job,9,10,Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.~)
(Job,9,11,Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.~)
(Job,9,12,Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?~)
(Job,9,13,If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.~)
(Job,9,14,How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?~)
(Job,9,15,Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.~)
(Job,9,16,If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.~)
(Job,9,17,For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.~)
(Job,9,18,He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.~)
(Job,9,19,If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?~)
(Job,9,20,If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.~)
(Job,9,21,Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.~)
(Job,9,22,This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.~)
(Job,9,23,If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.~)
(Job,9,24,The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?~)
(Job,9,25,Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.~)
(Job,9,26,They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.~)
(Job,9,27,If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:~)
(Job,9,28,I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.~)
(Job,9,29,If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?~)
(Job,9,30,If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;~)
(Job,9,31,Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.~)
(Job,9,32,For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.~)
(Job,9,33,Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.~)
(Job,9,34,Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:~)
(Job,9,35,Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.~)
(Job,10,1,My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.~)
(Job,10,2,I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.~)
(Job,10,3,Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?~)
(Job,10,4,Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?~)
(Job,10,5,Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,~)
(Job,10,6,That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?~)
(Job,10,7,Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.~)
(Job,10,8,Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.~)
(Job,10,9,Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?~)
(Job,10,10,Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?~)
(Job,10,11,Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.~)
(Job,10,12,Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.~)
(Job,10,13,And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.~)
(Job,10,14,If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.~)
(Job,10,15,If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;~)
(Job,10,16,For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.~)
(Job,10,17,Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.~)
(Job,10,18,Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!~)
(Job,10,19,I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.~)
(Job,10,20,Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,~)
(Job,10,21,Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;~)
(Job,10,22,A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.~)
(Job,11,1,Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,~)
(Job,11,2,Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?~)
(Job,11,3,Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?~)
(Job,11,4,For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.~)
(Job,11,5,But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;~)
(Job,11,6,And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.~)
(Job,11,7,Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?~)
(Job,11,8,It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?~)
(Job,11,9,The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.~)
(Job,11,10,If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?~)
(Job,11,11,For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?~)
(Job,11,12,For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.~)
(Job,11,13,If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;~)
(Job,11,14,If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.~)
(Job,11,15,For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:~)
(Job,11,16,Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:~)
(Job,11,17,And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.~)
(Job,11,18,And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.~)
(Job,11,19,Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.~)
(Job,11,20,But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.~)
(Job,12,1,And Job answered and said,~)
(Job,12,2,No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.~)
(Job,12,3,But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?~)
(Job,12,4,I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.~)
(Job,12,5,He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.~)
(Job,12,6,The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.~)
(Job,12,7,But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:~)
(Job,12,8,Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.~)
(Job,12,9,Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?~)
(Job,12,10,In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.~)
(Job,12,11,Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?~)
(Job,12,12,With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.~)
(Job,12,13,With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.~)
(Job,12,14,Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.~)
(Job,12,15,Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.~)
(Job,12,16,With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.~)
(Job,12,17,He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.~)
(Job,12,18,He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.~)
(Job,12,19,He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.~)
(Job,12,20,He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.~)
(Job,12,21,He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.~)
(Job,12,22,He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.~)
(Job,12,23,He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.~)
(Job,12,24,He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.~)
(Job,12,25,They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.~)
(Job,13,1,Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.~)
(Job,13,2,What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.~)
(Job,13,3,Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.~)
(Job,13,4,But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.~)
(Job,13,5,O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.~)
(Job,13,6,Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.~)
(Job,13,7,Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?~)
(Job,13,8,Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?~)
(Job,13,9,Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?~)
(Job,13,10,He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.~)
(Job,13,11,Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?~)
(Job,13,12,Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.~)
(Job,13,13,Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.~)

(Job,13,25,Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?~)
(Job,13,26,For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.~)

(Job,14,4,Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.~)
(Job,14,5,Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;~)
(Job,14,6,Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.~)
(Job,14,7,For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.~)

(Job,14,10,But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?~)
(Job,14,11,As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:~)
(Job,14,12,So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.~)
(Job,14,13,O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!~)
(Job,14,14,If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.~)

(Job,14,18,And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.~)
(Job,14,19,The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.~)

(Job,14,21,His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.~)
(Job,14,22,But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.~)
(Job,15,1,Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,~)
(Job,15,2,Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?~)
(Job,15,3,Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?~)
(Job,15,4,Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.~)

(Job,15,11,Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?~)
(Job,15,12,Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,~)
(Job,15,13,That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?~)
(Job,15,14,What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?~)
(Job,15,15,Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.~)
(Job,15,16,How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?~)
(Job,15,17,I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;~)
(Job,15,18,Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:~)
(Job,15,19,Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.~)

(Job,15,23,He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.~)
(Job,15,24,Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.~)
(Job,15,25,For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.~)
(Job,15,26,He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:~)
(Job,15,27,Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.~)
(Job,15,28,And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.~)
(Job,15,29,He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.~)
(Job,15,30,He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.~)
(Job,15,31,Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.~)
(Job,15,32,It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.~)
(Job,15,33,He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.~)
(Job,15,34,For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.~)
(Job,15,35,They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.~)
(Job,16,1,Then Job answered and said,~)
(Job,16,2,I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.~)
(Job,16,3,Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?~)
(Job,16,4,I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.~)
(Job,16,5,But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.~)
(Job,16,6,Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?~)
(Job,16,7,But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.~)
(Job,16,8,And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.~)
(Job,16,9,He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.~)
(Job,16,10,They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.~)
(Job,16,11,God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.~)
(Job,16,12,I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.~)
(Job,16,13,His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.~)
(Job,16,14,He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.~)
(Job,16,15,I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.~)
(Job,16,16,My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;~)
(Job,16,17,Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.~)
(Job,16,18,O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.~)
(Job,16,19,Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.~)
(Job,16,20,My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.~)
(Job,16,21,O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!~)
(Job,16,22,When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.~)
(Job,17,1,My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.~)
(Job,17,2,Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?~)
(Job,17,3,Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?~)
(Job,17,4,For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.~)
(Job,17,5,He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.~)
(Job,17,6,He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.~)
(Job,17,7,Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.~)
(Job,17,8,Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.~)
(Job,17,9,The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.~)
(Job,17,10,But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.~)
(Job,17,11,My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.~)
(Job,17,12,They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.~)
(Job,17,13,If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.~)
(Job,17,14,I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.~)
(Job,17,15,And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?~)
(Job,17,16,They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.~)
(Job,18,1,Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,~)
(Job,18,2,How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.~)
(Job,18,3,Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?~)
(Job,18,4,He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?~)
(Job,18,5,Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.~)
(Job,18,6,The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.~)
(Job,18,7,The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.~)
(Job,18,8,For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.~)
(Job,18,9,The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.~)
(Job,18,10,The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.~)
(Job,18,11,Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.~)
(Job,18,12,His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.~)
(Job,18,13,It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.~)
(Job,18,14,His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.~)
(Job,18,15,It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.~)
(Job,18,16,His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.~)
(Job,18,17,His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.~)
(Job,18,18,He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.~)
(Job,18,19,He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.~)
(Job,18,20,They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.~)
(Job,18,21,Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.~)
(Job,19,1,Then Job answered and said,~)
(Job,19,2,How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?~)
(Job,19,3,These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.~)
(Job,19,4,And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.~)
(Job,19,5,If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:~)
(Job,19,6,Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.~)
(Job,19,7,Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.~)
(Job,19,8,He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.~)
(Job,19,9,He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.~)
(Job,19,10,He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.~)
(Job,19,11,He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.~)
(Job,19,12,His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.~)
(Job,19,13,He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.~)
(Job,19,14,My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.~)
(Job,19,15,They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.~)
(Job,19,16,I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.~)
(Job,19,17,My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.~)
(Job,19,18,Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.~)
(Job,19,19,All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.~)
(Job,19,20,My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.~)
(Job,19,21,Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.~)
(Job,19,22,Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?~)
(Job,19,23,Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!~)
(Job,19,24,That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!~)
(Job,19,25,For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:~)
(Job,19,26,And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:~)
(Job,19,27,Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.~)
(Job,19,28,But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?~)
(Job,19,29,Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.~)
(Job,20,1,Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,~)
(Job,20,2,Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.~)
(Job,20,3,I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.~)
(Job,20,4,Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,~)
(Job,20,5,That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?~)
(Job,20,6,Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;~)
(Job,20,7,Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?~)
(Job,20,8,He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.~)
(Job,20,9,The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.~)
(Job,20,10,His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.~)
(Job,20,11,His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.~)
(Job,20,12,Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;~)
(Job,20,13,Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:~)
(Job,20,14,Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.~)
(Job,20,15,He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.~)
(Job,20,16,He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.~)
(Job,20,17,He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.~)
(Job,20,18,That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.~)
(Job,20,19,Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;~)
(Job,20,20,Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.~)
(Job,20,21,There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.~)
(Job,20,22,In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.~)
(Job,20,23,When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.~)
(Job,20,24,He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.~)
(Job,20,25,It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.~)
(Job,20,26,All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.~)
(Job,20,27,The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.~)
(Job,20,28,The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.~)
(Job,20,29,This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.~)
(Job,21,1,But Job answered and said,~)
(Job,21,2,Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.~)
(Job,21,3,Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.~)
(Job,21,4,As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?~)
(Job,21,5,Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.~)
(Job,21,6,Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.~)
(Job,21,7,Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?~)
(Job,21,8,Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.~)
(Job,21,9,Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.~)
(Job,21,10,Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.~)
(Job,21,11,They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.~)
(Job,21,12,They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.~)
(Job,21,13,They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.~)
(Job,21,14,Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.~)
(Job,21,15,What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?~)
(Job,21,16,Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.~)
(Job,21,17,How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.~)
(Job,21,18,They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.~)
(Job,21,19,God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.~)
(Job,21,20,His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.~)
(Job,21,21,For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?~)
(Job,21,22,Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.~)
(Job,21,23,One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.~)
(Job,21,24,His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.~)
(Job,21,25,And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.~)
(Job,21,26,They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.~)
(Job,21,27,Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.~)
(Job,21,28,For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?~)
(Job,21,29,Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,~)
(Job,21,30,That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.~)
(Job,21,31,Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?~)
(Job,21,32,Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.~)
(Job,21,33,The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.~)
(Job,21,34,How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?~)
(Job,22,1,Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,~)
(Job,22,2,Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?~)
(Job,22,3,Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?~)
(Job,22,4,Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?~)
(Job,22,5,Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?~)
(Job,22,6,For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.~)
(Job,22,7,Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.~)
(Job,22,8,But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.~)
(Job,22,9,Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.~)
(Job,22,10,Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;~)
(Job,22,11,Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.~)
(Job,22,12,Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!~)
(Job,22,13,And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?~)
(Job,22,14,Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.~)
(Job,22,15,Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?~)
(Job,22,16,Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:~)
(Job,22,17,Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?~)
(Job,22,18,Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.~)
(Job,22,19,The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.~)
(Job,22,20,Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.~)
(Job,22,21,Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.~)
(Job,22,22,Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.~)
(Job,22,23,If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.~)
(Job,22,24,Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.~)
(Job,22,25,Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.~)
(Job,22,26,For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.~)
(Job,22,27,Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.~)
(Job,22,28,Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.~)
(Job,22,29,When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.~)
(Job,22,30,He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.~)
(Job,23,1,Then Job answered and said,~)
(Job,23,2,Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.~)
(Job,23,3,Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!~)
(Job,23,4,I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.~)
(Job,23,5,I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.~)
(Job,23,6,Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.~)
(Job,23,7,There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.~)
(Job,23,8,Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:~)
(Job,23,9,On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:~)
(Job,23,10,But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.~)
(Job,23,11,My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.~)
(Job,23,12,Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.~)
(Job,23,13,But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.~)
(Job,23,14,For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.~)
(Job,23,15,Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.~)
(Job,23,16,For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:~)
(Job,23,17,Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.~)
(Job,24,1,Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?~)
(Job,24,2,Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.~)
(Job,24,3,They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.~)
(Job,24,4,They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.~)
(Job,24,5,Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.~)
(Job,24,6,They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.~)
(Job,24,7,They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.~)
(Job,24,8,They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.~)
(Job,24,9,They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.~)
(Job,24,10,They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;~)
(Job,24,11,Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.~)
(Job,24,12,Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.~)
(Job,24,13,They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.~)
(Job,24,14,The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.~)
(Job,24,15,The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.~)
(Job,24,16,In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.~)
(Job,24,17,For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.~)
(Job,24,18,He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.~)
(Job,24,19,Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.~)
(Job,24,20,The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.~)
(Job,24,21,He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.~)
(Job,24,22,He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.~)
(Job,24,23,Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.~)
(Job,24,24,They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.~)
(Job,24,25,And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?~)
(Job,25,1,Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,~)
(Job,25,2,Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.~)
(Job,25,3,Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?~)
(Job,25,4,How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?~)
(Job,25,5,Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.~)
(Job,25,6,How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?~)
(Job,26,1,But Job answered and said,~)
(Job,26,2,How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?~)
(Job,26,3,How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?~)
(Job,26,4,To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?~)
(Job,26,5,Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.~)
(Job,26,6,Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.~)
(Job,26,7,He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.~)
(Job,26,8,He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.~)
(Job,26,9,He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.~)
(Job,26,10,He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.~)
(Job,26,11,The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.~)
(Job,26,12,He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.~)
(Job,26,13,By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.~)
(Job,26,14,Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?~)
(Job,27,1,Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,~)
(Job,27,2,As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;~)
(Job,27,3,All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;~)

(Job,27,16,Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;~)
(Job,27,17,He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.~)
(Job,27,18,He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.~)
(Job,27,19,The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.~)
(Job,27,20,Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.~)
(Job,27,21,The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.~)

(Job,28,9,He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.~)
(Job,28,10,He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.~)
(Job,28,11,He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.~)

(Job,28,25,To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.~)
(Job,28,26,When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:~)

(Job,29,11,When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:~)
(Job,29,12,Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.~)
(Job,29,13,The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.~)
(Job,29,14,I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.~)
(Job,29,15,I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.~)

(Job,31,2,For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?~)
(Job,31,3,Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?~)
(Job,31,4,Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?~)
(Job,31,5,If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;~)
(Job,31,6,Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.~)
(Job,31,7,If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;~)
(Job,31,8,Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.~)
(Job,31,9,If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;~)
(Job,31,10,Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.~)
(Job,31,11,For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.~)
(Job,31,12,For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.~)
(Job,31,13,If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;~)
(Job,31,14,What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?~)
(Job,31,15,Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?~)

(Job,31,18,(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)~)
(Job,31,19,If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;~)
(Job,31,20,If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;~)
(Job,31,21,If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:~)
(Job,31,22,Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.~)
(Job,31,23,For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.~)
(Job,31,24,If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;~)
(Job,31,25,If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;~)
(Job,31,26,If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;~)
(Job,31,27,And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:~)
(Job,31,28,This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.~)

(Job,31,32,The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.~)
(Job,31,33,If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:~)
(Job,31,34,Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?~)
(Job,31,35,Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.~)
(Job,31,36,Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.~)
(Job,31,37,I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.~)
(Job,31,38,If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;~)
(Job,31,39,If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:~)
(Job,31,40,Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.~)
(Job,32,1,So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.~)
(Job,32,2,Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.~)
(Job,32,3,Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.~)
(Job,32,4,Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.~)
(Job,32,5,When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.~)
(Job,32,6,And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.~)
(Job,32,7,I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.~)
(Job,32,8,But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.~)
(Job,32,9,Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.~)
(Job,32,10,Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.~)
(Job,32,11,Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.~)
(Job,32,12,Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:~)
(Job,32,13,Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.~)
(Job,32,14,Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.~)
(Job,32,15,They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.~)
(Job,32,16,When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)~)
(Job,32,17,I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.~)
(Job,32,18,For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.~)
(Job,32,19,Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.~)
(Job,32,20,I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.~)
(Job,32,21,Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.~)
(Job,32,22,For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.~)
(Job,33,1,Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.~)
(Job,33,2,Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.~)
(Job,33,3,My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.~)
(Job,33,4,The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.~)
(Job,33,5,If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.~)
(Job,33,6,Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.~)
(Job,33,7,Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.~)
(Job,33,8,Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,~)
(Job,33,9,I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.~)
(Job,33,10,Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,~)
(Job,33,11,He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.~)
(Job,33,12,Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.~)
(Job,33,13,Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.~)
(Job,33,14,For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.~)
(Job,33,15,In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;~)
(Job,33,16,Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,~)
(Job,33,17,That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.~)
(Job,33,18,He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.~)
(Job,33,19,He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:~)
(Job,33,20,So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.~)
(Job,33,21,His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.~)
(Job,33,22,Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.~)
(Job,33,23,If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:~)
(Job,33,24,Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.~)
(Job,33,25,His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:~)
(Job,33,26,He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.~)
(Job,33,27,He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;~)
(Job,33,28,He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.~)
(Job,33,29,Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,~)
(Job,33,30,To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.~)
(Job,33,31,Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.~)
(Job,33,32,If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.~)
(Job,33,33,If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.~)
(Job,34,1,Furthermore Elihu answered and said,~)
(Job,34,2,Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.~)
(Job,34,3,For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.~)
(Job,34,4,Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.~)
(Job,34,5,For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.~)
(Job,34,6,Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.~)
(Job,34,7,What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?~)
(Job,34,8,Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.~)
(Job,34,9,For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.~)
(Job,34,10,Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.~)
(Job,34,11,For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.~)
(Job,34,12,Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.~)
(Job,34,13,Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?~)
(Job,34,14,If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;~)
(Job,34,15,All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.~)
(Job,34,16,If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.~)
(Job,34,17,Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?~)
(Job,34,18,Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?~)
(Job,34,19,How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.~)
(Job,34,20,In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.~)
(Job,34,21,For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.~)
(Job,34,22,There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.~)
(Job,34,23,For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.~)
(Job,34,24,He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.~)
(Job,34,25,Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.~)
(Job,34,26,He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;~)
(Job,34,27,Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:~)
(Job,34,28,So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.~)
(Job,34,29,When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:~)
(Job,34,30,That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.~)
(Job,34,31,Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:~)
(Job,34,32,That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.~)
(Job,34,33,Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.~)
(Job,34,34,Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.~)
(Job,34,35,Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.~)
(Job,34,36,My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.~)
(Job,34,37,For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.~)
(Job,35,1,Elihu spake moreover, and said,~)
(Job,35,2,Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?~)
(Job,35,3,For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?~)
(Job,35,4,I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.~)
(Job,35,5,Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.~)
(Job,35,6,If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?~)
(Job,35,7,If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?~)
(Job,35,8,Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.~)
(Job,35,9,By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.~)
(Job,35,10,But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;~)
(Job,35,11,Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?~)
(Job,35,12,There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.~)
(Job,35,13,Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.~)
(Job,35,14,Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.~)
(Job,35,15,But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:~)
(Job,35,16,Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.~)
(Job,36,1,Elihu also proceeded, and said,~)
(Job,36,2,Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.~)
(Job,36,3,I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.~)
(Job,36,4,For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.~)
(Job,36,5,Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.~)
(Job,36,6,He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.~)
(Job,36,7,He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.~)
(Job,36,8,And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;~)
(Job,36,9,Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.~)
(Job,36,10,He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.~)
(Job,36,11,If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.~)
(Job,36,12,But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.~)
(Job,36,13,But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.~)
(Job,36,14,They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.~)
(Job,36,15,He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.~)
(Job,36,16,Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.~)
(Job,36,17,But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.~)
(Job,36,18,Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.~)
(Job,36,19,Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.~)
(Job,36,20,Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.~)
(Job,36,21,Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.~)
(Job,36,22,Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?~)
(Job,36,23,Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?~)
(Job,36,24,Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.~)
(Job,36,25,Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.~)
(Job,36,26,Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.~)
(Job,36,27,For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:~)
(Job,36,28,Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.~)
(Job,36,29,Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?~)
(Job,36,30,Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.~)
(Job,36,31,For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.~)
(Job,36,32,With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.~)
(Job,36,33,The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.~)
(Job,37,1,At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.~)
(Job,37,2,Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.~)
(Job,37,3,He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.~)
(Job,37,4,After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.~)
(Job,37,5,God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.~)
(Job,37,6,For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.~)
(Job,37,7,He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.~)
(Job,37,8,Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.~)
(Job,37,9,Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.~)
(Job,37,10,By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.~)
(Job,37,11,Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:~)
(Job,37,12,And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.~)
(Job,37,13,He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.~)
(Job,37,14,Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.~)
(Job,37,15,Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?~)
(Job,37,16,Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?~)
(Job,37,17,How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?~)
(Job,37,18,Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?~)
(Job,37,19,Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.~)
(Job,37,20,Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.~)
(Job,37,21,And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.~)
(Job,37,22,Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.~)
(Job,37,23,Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.~)
(Job,37,24,Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.~)
(Job,38,1,Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,~)
(Job,38,2,Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?~)
(Job,38,3,Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.~)
(Job,38,4,Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.~)
(Job,38,5,Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?~)
(Job,38,6,Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;~)
(Job,38,7,When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?~)
(Job,38,8,Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?~)
(Job,38,9,When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,~)
(Job,38,10,And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,~)
(Job,38,11,And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?~)
(Job,38,12,Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;~)
(Job,38,13,That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?~)
(Job,38,14,It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.~)
(Job,38,15,And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.~)
(Job,38,16,Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?~)

(Job,38,18,Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.~)
(Job,38,19,Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,~)
(Job,38,20,That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?~)
(Job,38,21,Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?~)
(Job,38,22,Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,~)
(Job,38,23,Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?~)
(Job,38,24,By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?~)
(Job,38,25,Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;~)
(Job,38,26,To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;~)
(Job,38,27,To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?~)
(Job,38,28,Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?~)
(Job,38,29,Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?~)
(Job,38,30,The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.~)
(Job,38,31,Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?~)

(Job,38,41,Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.~)
(Job,39,1,Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?~)
(Job,39,2,Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?~)
(Job,39,3,They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.~)
(Job,39,4,Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.~)
(Job,39,5,Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?~)
(Job,39,6,Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.~)
(Job,39,7,He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.~)
(Job,39,8,The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.~)
(Job,39,9,Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?~)
(Job,39,10,Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?~)
(Job,39,11,Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?~)
(Job,39,12,Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?~)
(Job,39,13,Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?~)
(Job,39,14,Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,~)
(Job,39,15,And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.~)
(Job,39,16,She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;~)
(Job,39,17,Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.~)
(Job,39,18,What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.~)
(Job,39,19,Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?~)
(Job,39,20,Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.~)
(Job,39,21,He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.~)
(Job,39,22,He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.~)
(Job,39,23,The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.~)
(Job,39,24,He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.~)
(Job,39,25,He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.~)
(Job,39,26,Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?~)
(Job,39,27,Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?~)
(Job,39,28,She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.~)
(Job,39,29,From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.~)
(Job,39,30,Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.~)
(Job,40,1,Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,~)
(Job,40,2,Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.~)
(Job,40,3,Then Job answered the LORD, and said,~)
(Job,40,4,Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.~)
(Job,40,5,Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.~)
(Job,40,6,Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,~)
(Job,40,7,Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.~)
(Job,40,8,Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?~)
(Job,40,9,Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?~)
(Job,40,10,Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.~)
(Job,40,11,Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.~)
(Job,40,12,Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.~)
(Job,40,13,Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.~)
(Job,40,14,Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.~)
(Job,40,15,Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.~)
(Job,40,16,Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.~)
(Job,40,17,He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.~)
(Job,40,18,His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.~)
(Job,40,19,He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.~)
(Job,40,20,Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.~)
(Job,40,21,He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.~)
(Job,40,22,The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.~)
(Job,40,23,Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.~)
(Job,40,24,He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.~)
(Job,41,1,Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?~)
(Job,41,2,Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?~)
(Job,41,3,Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?~)
(Job,41,4,Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?~)
(Job,41,5,Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?~)
(Job,41,6,Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?~)
(Job,41,7,Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?~)
(Job,41,8,Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.~)
(Job,41,9,Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?~)
(Job,41,10,None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?~)
(Job,41,11,Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.~)
(Job,41,12,I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.~)
(Job,41,13,Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?~)
(Job,41,14,Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.~)
(Job,41,15,His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.~)
(Job,41,16,One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.~)
(Job,41,17,They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.~)
(Job,41,18,By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.~)
(Job,41,19,Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.~)
(Job,41,20,Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.~)
(Job,41,21,His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.~)
(Job,41,22,In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.~)
(Job,41,23,The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.~)
(Job,41,24,His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.~)
(Job,41,25,When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.~)
(Job,41,26,The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.~)
(Job,41,27,He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.~)
(Job,41,28,The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.~)
(Job,41,29,Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.~)
(Job,41,30,Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.~)
(Job,41,31,He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.~)
(Job,41,32,He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.~)
(Job,41,33,Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.~)
(Job,41,34,He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.~)
(Job,42,1,Then Job answered the LORD, and said,~)
(Job,42,2,I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.~)
(Job,42,3,Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.~)
(Job,42,4,Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.~)
(Job,42,5,I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.~)
(Job,42,6,Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.~)
(Job,42,7,And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.~)
(Job,42,8,Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.~)
(Job,42,9,So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.~)
(Job,42,10,And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.~)
(Job,42,11,Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.~)
(Job,42,12,So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.~)
(Job,42,13,He had also seven sons and three daughters.~)
(Job,42,14,And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.~)
(Job,42,15,And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.~)
(Job,42,16,After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.~)
(Job,42,17,So Job died, being old and full of days.~)
(Jonah,1,1,Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,~)
(Jonah,1,2,Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.~)
(Jonah,1,3,But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.~)
(Jonah,1,4,But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.~)
(Jonah,1,5,Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.~)
(Jonah,1,6,So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.~)
(Jonah,1,7,And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.~)
(Jonah,1,8,Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?~)
(Jonah,1,9,And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.~)
(Jonah,1,10,Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.~)
(Jonah,1,11,Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.~)
(Jonah,1,12,And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.~)
(Jonah,1,13,Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.~)
(Jonah,1,14,Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.~)
(Jonah,1,15,So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.~)
(Jonah,1,16,Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.~)
(Jonah,1,17,Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.~)
(Jonah,2,1,Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,~)
(Jonah,2,2,And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.~)
(Jonah,2,3,For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.~)
(Jonah,2,4,Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.~)
(Jonah,2,5,The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.~)
(Jonah,2,6,I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.~)
(Jonah,2,7,When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.~)
(Jonah,2,8,They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.~)
(Jonah,2,9,But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.~)
(Jonah,2,10,And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.~)
(Jonah,3,1,And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,~)
(Jonah,3,2,Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.~)
(Jonah,3,3,So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey.~)
(Jonah,3,4,And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.~)
(Jonah,3,5,So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.~)
(Jonah,3,6,For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.~)
(Jonah,3,7,And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:~)
(Jonah,3,8,But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.~)
(Jonah,3,9,Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?~)
(Jonah,3,10,And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.~)
(Jonah,4,1,But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.~)
(Jonah,4,2,And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.~)
