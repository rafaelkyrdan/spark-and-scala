(1 Timothy,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;~)
(1 Timothy,1,2,Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.~)
(1 Timothy,1,3,As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,~)
(1 Timothy,1,4,Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.~)
(1 Timothy,1,5,Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:~)
(1 Timothy,1,6,From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;~)
(1 Timothy,1,7,Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.~)
(1 Timothy,1,8,But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;~)
(1 Timothy,1,9,Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,~)
(1 Timothy,1,10,For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;~)
(1 Timothy,1,11,According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.~)
(1 Timothy,1,12,And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;~)
(1 Timothy,1,13,Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.~)
(1 Timothy,1,14,And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.~)
(1 Timothy,1,15,This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.~)
(1 Timothy,1,16,Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.~)
(1 Timothy,1,17,Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.~)
(1 Timothy,1,18,This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;~)
(1 Timothy,1,19,Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:~)
(1 Timothy,1,20,Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.~)
(1 Timothy,2,1,I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;~)
(1 Timothy,2,2,For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.~)
(1 Timothy,2,3,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;~)
(1 Timothy,2,4,Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.~)
(1 Timothy,2,5,For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;~)
(1 Timothy,2,6,Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.~)
(1 Timothy,2,7,Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.~)
(1 Timothy,2,8,I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.~)
(1 Timothy,2,9,In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;~)
(1 Timothy,2,10,But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.~)
(1 Timothy,2,11,Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.~)
(1 Timothy,2,12,But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.~)
(1 Timothy,2,13,For Adam was first formed, then Eve.~)
(1 Timothy,2,14,And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.~)
(1 Timothy,2,15,Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.~)
(1 Timothy,3,1,This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.~)
(1 Timothy,3,2,A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;~)
(1 Timothy,3,3,Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;~)
(1 Timothy,3,4,One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;~)
(1 Timothy,3,5,(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)~)
(1 Timothy,3,6,Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.~)
(1 Timothy,3,7,Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.~)
(1 Timothy,3,8,Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;~)
(1 Timothy,3,9,Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.~)
(1 Timothy,3,10,And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless.~)
(1 Timothy,3,11,Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.~)
(1 Timothy,3,12,Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.~)
(1 Timothy,3,13,For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.~)
(1 Timothy,3,14,These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:~)
(1 Timothy,3,15,But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.~)
(1 Timothy,3,16,And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.~)
(1 Timothy,4,1,Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;~)
(1 Timothy,4,2,Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;~)
(1 Timothy,4,3,Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.~)
(1 Timothy,4,4,For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:~)
(1 Timothy,4,5,For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.~)
(1 Timothy,4,6,If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.~)
(1 Timothy,4,7,But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.~)
(1 Timothy,4,8,For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.~)
(1 Timothy,4,9,This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.~)
(1 Timothy,4,10,For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.~)
(1 Timothy,4,11,These things command and teach.~)
(1 Timothy,4,12,Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.~)
(1 Timothy,4,13,Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.~)
(1 Timothy,4,14,Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.~)
(1 Timothy,4,15,Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.~)
(1 Timothy,4,16,Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.~)
(1 Timothy,5,1,Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;~)
(1 Timothy,5,2,The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.~)
(1 Timothy,5,3,Honour widows that are widows indeed.~)
(1 Timothy,5,4,But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.~)
(1 Timothy,5,5,Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.~)
(1 Timothy,5,6,But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.~)
(1 Timothy,5,7,And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.~)
(1 Timothy,5,8,But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.~)
(1 Timothy,5,9,Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man.~)
(1 Timothy,5,10,Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.~)
(1 Timothy,5,11,But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;~)
(1 Timothy,5,12,Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.~)
(1 Timothy,5,13,And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.~)
(1 Timothy,5,14,I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.~)
(1 Timothy,5,15,For some are already turned aside after Satan.~)
(1 Timothy,5,16,If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.~)
(1 Timothy,5,17,Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.~)
(1 Timothy,5,18,For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.~)
(1 Timothy,5,19,Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.~)
(1 Timothy,5,20,Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.~)
(1 Timothy,5,21,I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.~)
(1 Timothy,5,22,Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure.~)
(1 Timothy,5,23,Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.~)
(1 Timothy,5,24,Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.~)
(1 Timothy,5,25,Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.~)
(1 Timothy,6,1,Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.~)
(1 Timothy,6,2,And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.~)
(1 Timothy,6,3,If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;~)
(1 Timothy,6,4,He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,~)
(1 Timothy,6,5,Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.~)
(1 Timothy,6,6,But godliness with contentment is great gain.~)
(1 Timothy,6,7,For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.~)
(1 Timothy,6,8,And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.~)
(1 Timothy,6,9,But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.~)
(1 Timothy,6,10,For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.~)
(1 Timothy,6,11,But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.~)
(1 Timothy,6,12,Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.~)
(1 Timothy,6,13,I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;~)
(1 Timothy,6,14,That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:~)
(1 Timothy,6,15,Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;~)
(1 Timothy,6,16,Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.~)
(1 Timothy,6,17,Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;~)
(1 Timothy,6,18,That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;~)
(1 Timothy,6,19,Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.~)
(1 Timothy,6,20,O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:~)
(1 Timothy,6,21,Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.~)
(Esther,1,1,Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)~)
(Esther,1,2,That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,~)
(Esther,1,3,In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:~)
(Esther,1,4,When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.~)
(Esther,1,5,And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;~)
(Esther,1,6,Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.~)
(Esther,1,7,And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the state of the king.~)
(Esther,1,8,And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.~)
(Esther,1,9,Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.~)
(Esther,1,10,On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,~)
(Esther,1,11,To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on.~)
(Esther,1,12,But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him.~)
(Esther,1,13,Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:~)
(Esther,1,14,And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)~)
(Esther,1,15,What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?~)
(Esther,1,16,And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.~)
(Esther,1,17,For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.~)
(Esther,1,18,Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.~)
(Esther,1,19,If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.~)
(Esther,1,20,And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.~)
(Esther,1,21,And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan:~)
(Esther,1,22,For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people.~)
(Esther,2,1,After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.~)
(Esther,2,2,Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:~)
(Esther,2,3,And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:~)
(Esther,2,4,And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.~)
(Esther,2,5,Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;~)
(Esther,2,6,Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.~)
(Esther,2,7,And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.~)
(Esther,2,8,So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.~)
(Esther,2,9,And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.~)
(Esther,2,10,Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.~)
(Esther,2,11,And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.~)
(Esther,2,12,Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)~)
(Esther,2,13,Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house.~)
(Esther,2,14,In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.~)
(Esther,2,15,Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.~)
(Esther,2,16,So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.~)
(Esther,2,17,And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.~)
(Esther,2,18,Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.~)
(Esther,2,19,And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.~)
(Esther,2,20,Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.~)
(Esther,2,21,In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus.~)
(Esther,2,22,And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.~)
(Esther,2,23,And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.~)
(Esther,3,1,After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.~)
(Esther,3,2,And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.~)
(Esther,3,3,Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?~)
(Esther,3,4,Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.~)
(Esther,3,5,And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.~)
(Esther,3,6,And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.~)
(Esther,3,7,In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.~)
(Esther,3,8,And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.~)
(Esther,3,9,If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.~)
(Esther,3,10,And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.~)
(Esther,3,11,And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.~)
(Esther,3,12,Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.~)
(Esther,3,13,And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.~)
(Esther,3,14,The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, that they should be ready against that day.~)
(Esther,3,15,The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.~)
(Esther,4,1,When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;~)
(Esther,4,2,And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.~)
(Esther,4,3,And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.~)
(Esther,4,4,So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.~)
(Esther,4,5,Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.~)
(Esther,4,6,So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which was before the king's gate.~)
(Esther,4,7,And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.~)
(Esther,4,8,Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her people.~)
(Esther,4,9,And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.~)
(Esther,4,10,Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto Mordecai;~)
(Esther,4,11,All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.~)
(Esther,4,12,And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.~)
(Esther,4,13,Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.~)
(Esther,4,14,For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?~)
(Esther,4,15,Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,~)
(Esther,4,16,Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.~)
(Esther,4,17,So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.~)
(Esther,5,1,Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.~)
(Esther,5,2,And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.~)
(Esther,5,3,Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.~)
(Esther,5,4,And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.~)
(Esther,5,5,Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.~)
(Esther,5,6,And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.~)
(Esther,5,7,Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;~)
(Esther,5,8,If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.~)
(Esther,5,9,Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.~)
(Esther,5,10,Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.~)
(Esther,5,11,And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.~)
(Esther,5,12,Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.~)
(Esther,5,13,Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.~)
(Esther,5,14,Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.~)
(Esther,6,1,On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.~)
(Esther,6,2,And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.~)
(Esther,6,3,And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.~)
(Esther,6,4,And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.~)
(Esther,6,5,And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.~)
(Esther,6,6,So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?~)
(Esther,6,7,And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,~)
(Esther,6,8,Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:~)
(Esther,6,9,And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.~)
(Esther,6,10,Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.~)
(Esther,6,11,Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.~)
(Esther,6,12,And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.~)
(Esther,6,13,And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.~)
(Esther,6,14,And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.~)
(Esther,7,1,So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.~)
(Esther,7,2,And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.~)
(Esther,7,3,Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:~)
(Esther,7,4,For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.~)
(Esther,7,5,Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?~)
(Esther,7,6,And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.~)
(Esther,7,7,And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.~)
(Esther,7,8,Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.~)
(Esther,7,9,And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.~)
(Esther,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.~)
(Esther,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.~)
(Esther,8,2,And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.~)
(Esther,8,3,And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.~)
(Esther,8,4,Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,~)
(Esther,8,5,And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:~)
(Esther,8,6,For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?~)
(Esther,8,7,Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.~)
(Esther,8,8,Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.~)
(Esther,8,9,Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.~)
(Esther,8,10,And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:~)
(Esther,8,11,Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,~)
(Esther,8,12,Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.~)
(Esther,8,13,The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.~)
(Esther,8,14,So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.~)
(Esther,8,15,And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.~)
(Esther,8,16,The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.~)
(Esther,8,17,And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.~)
(Esther,9,1,Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)~)
(Esther,9,2,The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.~)
(Esther,9,3,And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.~)
(Esther,9,4,For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.~)
(Esther,9,5,Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.~)
(Esther,9,6,And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.~)
(Esther,9,7,And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,~)
(Esther,9,8,And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,~)
(Esther,9,9,And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,~)
(Esther,9,10,The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.~)
(Esther,9,11,On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.~)
(Esther,9,12,And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.~)
(Esther,9,13,Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.~)
(Esther,9,14,And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.~)
(Esther,9,15,For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.~)
(Esther,9,16,But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,~)
(Esther,9,17,On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.~)
(Esther,9,18,But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.~)
(Esther,9,19,Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.~)
(Esther,9,20,And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,~)
(Esther,9,21,To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,~)
(Esther,9,22,As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.~)
(Esther,9,23,And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;~)
(Esther,9,24,Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;~)
(Esther,9,25,But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.~)
(Esther,9,26,Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,~)
(Esther,9,27,The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;~)
(Esther,9,28,And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.~)
(Esther,9,29,Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.~)
(Esther,9,30,And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,~)
(Esther,9,31,To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.~)
(Esther,9,32,And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.~)
(Esther,10,1,And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.~)
(Esther,10,2,And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?~)
(Esther,10,3,For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.~)
(Genesis,1,1,In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.~)
(Genesis,1,2,And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.~)
(Genesis,1,3,And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.~)
(Genesis,1,4,And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.~)
(Genesis,1,5,And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.~)
(Genesis,1,6,And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.~)
(Genesis,1,7,And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.~)
(Genesis,1,8,And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.~)
(Genesis,1,9,And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.~)
(Genesis,1,10,And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.~)
(Genesis,1,11,And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.~)
(Genesis,1,12,And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.~)
(Genesis,1,13,And the evening and the morning were the third day.~)
(Genesis,1,14,And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:~)
(Genesis,1,15,And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.~)
(Genesis,1,16,And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.~)
(Genesis,1,17,And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,~)
(Genesis,1,18,And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.~)
(Genesis,1,19,And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.~)
(Genesis,1,20,And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.~)
(Genesis,1,21,And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.~)
(Genesis,1,22,And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.~)
(Genesis,1,23,And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.~)
(Genesis,1,24,And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.~)
(Genesis,1,25,And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.~)
(Genesis,1,26,And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.~)
(Genesis,1,27,So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.~)
(Genesis,1,28,And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.~)
(Genesis,1,29,And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.~)
(Genesis,1,30,And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.~)
(Genesis,1,31,And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.~)
(Genesis,2,1,Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.~)
(Genesis,2,2,And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.~)
(Genesis,2,3,And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.~)
(Genesis,2,4,These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,~)
(Genesis,2,5,And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.~)
(Genesis,2,6,But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.~)
(Genesis,2,7,And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.~)
(Genesis,2,8,And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.~)
(Genesis,2,9,And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.~)
(Genesis,2,10,And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.~)
(Genesis,2,11,The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;~)
(Genesis,2,12,And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.~)
(Genesis,2,13,And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.~)
(Genesis,2,14,And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.~)
(Genesis,2,15,And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.~)
(Genesis,2,16,And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:~)
(Genesis,2,17,But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.~)
(Genesis,2,18,And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.~)
(Genesis,2,19,And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.~)
(Genesis,2,20,And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.~)
(Genesis,2,21,And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;~)
(Genesis,2,22,And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.~)
(Genesis,2,23,And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.~)
(Genesis,2,24,Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.~)
(Genesis,2,25,And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.~)
(Genesis,3,1,Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?~)
(Genesis,3,2,And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:~)
(Genesis,3,3,But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.~)
(Genesis,3,4,And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:~)
(Genesis,3,5,For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.~)
(Genesis,3,6,And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.~)
(Genesis,3,7,And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.~)
(Genesis,3,8,And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.~)
(Genesis,3,9,And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?~)
(Genesis,3,10,And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.~)
(Genesis,3,11,And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?~)
(Genesis,3,12,And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.~)
(Genesis,3,13,And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.~)
(Genesis,3,14,And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:~)
(Genesis,3,15,And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.~)
(Genesis,3,16,Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.~)
(Genesis,3,17,And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;~)
(Genesis,3,18,Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;~)

(Genesis,3,20,And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.~)
(Genesis,3,21,Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.~)
(Genesis,3,22,And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:~)
(Genesis,3,23,Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.~)
(Genesis,3,24,So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.~)

(Genesis,20,4,But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?~)
(Genesis,20,5,Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.~)
(Genesis,20,6,And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.~)

(Genesis,20,10,And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?~)
(Genesis,20,11,And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.~)

(Genesis,20,14,And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.~)
(Genesis,20,15,And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.~)
(Genesis,20,16,And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.~)
(Genesis,20,17,So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.~)
(Genesis,20,18,For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.~)
(Genesis,21,1,And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.~)
(Genesis,21,2,For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.~)

(Genesis,21,11,And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.~)
(Genesis,21,12,And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.~)
(Genesis,21,13,And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.~)
(Genesis,21,14,And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.~)
(Genesis,21,15,And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.~)
(Genesis,21,16,And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.~)
(Genesis,21,17,And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.~)
(Genesis,21,18,Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.~)
(Genesis,21,19,And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.~)
(Genesis,21,20,And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.~)
(Genesis,21,21,And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.~)
(Genesis,21,22,And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:~)
(Genesis,21,23,Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.~)
(Genesis,21,24,And Abraham said, I will swear.~)
(Genesis,21,25,And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.~)

(Genesis,21,30,And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.~)
(Genesis,21,31,Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.~)
(Genesis,21,32,Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.~)
(Genesis,21,33,And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.~)
(Genesis,21,34,And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.~)
(Genesis,22,1,And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.~)
(Genesis,22,2,And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.~)

(Genesis,30,27,And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.~)
(Genesis,30,28,And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.~)
(Genesis,30,29,And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.~)
(Genesis,30,30,For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?~)
(Genesis,30,31,And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.~)
(Genesis,30,32,I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.~)
(Genesis,30,33,So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.~)
(Genesis,30,34,And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.~)
(Genesis,30,35,And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.~)
(Genesis,30,36,And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.~)
(Genesis,30,37,And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.~)
(Genesis,30,38,And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.~)
(Genesis,30,39,And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.~)
(Genesis,30,40,And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.~)
(Genesis,30,41,And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.~)
(Genesis,30,42,But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.~)
(Genesis,30,43,And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.~)
(Genesis,31,1,And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.~)
(Genesis,31,2,And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.~)
(Genesis,31,3,And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.~)
(Genesis,31,4,And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,~)
(Genesis,31,5,And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.~)
(Genesis,31,6,And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.~)
(Genesis,31,7,And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.~)
(Genesis,31,8,If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.~)
(Genesis,31,9,Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.~)
(Genesis,31,10,And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.~)
(Genesis,31,11,And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.~)
(Genesis,31,12,And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.~)
(Genesis,31,13,I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.~)
(Genesis,31,14,And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?~)
(Genesis,31,15,Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.~)
(Genesis,31,16,For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.~)
(Genesis,31,17,Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;~)
(Genesis,31,18,And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.~)
(Genesis,31,19,And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.~)
(Genesis,31,20,And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.~)
(Genesis,31,21,So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.~)
(Genesis,31,22,And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.~)
(Genesis,31,23,And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.~)
(Genesis,31,24,And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.~)
(Genesis,31,25,Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.~)
(Genesis,31,26,And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?~)
(Genesis,31,27,Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?~)
(Genesis,31,28,And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.~)
(Genesis,31,29,It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.~)
(Genesis,31,30,And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?~)
(Genesis,31,31,And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.~)
(Genesis,31,32,With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.~)
(Genesis,31,33,And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.~)
(Genesis,31,34,Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.~)
(Genesis,31,35,And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images.~)
(Genesis,31,36,And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?~)
(Genesis,31,37,Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.~)
(Genesis,31,38,This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.~)
(Genesis,31,39,That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.~)
(Genesis,31,40,Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.~)
(Genesis,31,41,Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.~)
(Genesis,31,42,Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.~)
(Genesis,31,43,And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?~)
(Genesis,31,44,Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.~)
(Genesis,31,45,And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.~)

(Genesis,31,48,And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;~)
(Genesis,31,49,And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.~)
(Genesis,31,50,If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.~)
(Genesis,31,51,And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:~)
(Genesis,31,52,This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.~)
(Genesis,31,53,The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.~)

(Genesis,32,5,And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.~)
(Genesis,32,6,And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.~)
(Genesis,32,7,Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;~)
(Genesis,32,8,And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.~)
(Genesis,32,9,And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:~)
(Genesis,32,10,I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.~)
(Genesis,32,11,Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.~)
(Genesis,32,12,And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.~)
(Genesis,32,13,And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;~)
(Genesis,32,14,Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,~)
(Genesis,32,15,Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.~)
(Genesis,32,16,And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.~)
(Genesis,32,17,And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?~)
(Genesis,32,18,Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.~)
(Genesis,32,19,And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.~)
(Genesis,32,20,And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.~)
(Genesis,32,21,So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.~)
(Genesis,32,22,And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.~)

(Genesis,32,32,Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.~)
(Genesis,33,1,And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.~)

(Genesis,33,9,And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself.~)
(Genesis,33,10,And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.~)
(Genesis,33,11,Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.~)
(Genesis,33,12,And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.~)

(Genesis,37,3,Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.~)
(Genesis,37,4,And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.~)
(Genesis,37,5,And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.~)
(Genesis,37,6,And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:~)
(Genesis,37,7,For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.~)
(Genesis,37,8,And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.~)
(Genesis,37,9,And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.~)
(Genesis,37,10,And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?~)
(Genesis,37,11,And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.~)
(Genesis,37,12,And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.~)

(Genesis,37,15,And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?~)

(Genesis,37,28,Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.~)
(Genesis,37,29,And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.~)
(Genesis,37,30,And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?~)
(Genesis,37,31,And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;~)
(Genesis,37,32,And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.~)
(Genesis,37,33,And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.~)
(Genesis,37,34,And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.~)
(Genesis,37,35,And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.~)
(Genesis,37,36,And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.~)
(Genesis,38,1,And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.~)
(Genesis,38,2,And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.~)
(Genesis,38,3,And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.~)
(Genesis,38,4,And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.~)
(Genesis,38,5,And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.~)
(Genesis,38,6,And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.~)
(Genesis,38,7,And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.~)
(Genesis,38,8,And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.~)
(Genesis,38,9,And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.~)
(Genesis,38,10,And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.~)
(Genesis,38,11,Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.~)
(Genesis,38,12,And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.~)
(Genesis,38,13,And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.~)
(Genesis,38,14,And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.~)
(Genesis,38,15,When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.~)
(Genesis,38,16,And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?~)
(Genesis,38,17,And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?~)
(Genesis,38,18,And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.~)
(Genesis,38,19,And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.~)
(Genesis,38,20,And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.~)
(Genesis,38,21,Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.~)
(Genesis,38,22,And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.~)
(Genesis,38,23,And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.~)
(Genesis,38,24,And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.~)
(Genesis,38,25,When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.~)
(Genesis,38,26,And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.~)
(Genesis,38,27,And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.~)
(Genesis,38,28,And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.~)
(Genesis,38,29,And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.~)
(Genesis,38,30,And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.~)
(Genesis,39,1,And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.~)
(Genesis,39,2,And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.~)
(Genesis,39,3,And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.~)
(Genesis,39,4,And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.~)
(Genesis,39,5,And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.~)
(Genesis,39,6,And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured.~)
(Genesis,39,7,And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.~)
(Genesis,39,8,But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand;~)
(Genesis,39,9,There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?~)
(Genesis,39,10,And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.~)
(Genesis,39,11,And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within.~)
(Genesis,39,12,And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.~)
(Genesis,39,13,And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,~)
(Genesis,39,14,That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:~)
(Genesis,39,15,And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.~)
(Genesis,39,16,And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.~)
(Genesis,39,17,And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:~)
(Genesis,39,18,And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.~)
(Genesis,39,19,And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.~)
(Genesis,39,20,And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.~)
(Genesis,39,21,But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.~)
(Genesis,39,22,And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.~)
(Genesis,39,23,The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper.~)
(Genesis,40,1,And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.~)
(Genesis,40,2,And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.~)
(Genesis,40,3,And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.~)
(Genesis,40,4,And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward.~)
(Genesis,40,5,And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison.~)
(Genesis,40,6,And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.~)
(Genesis,40,7,And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?~)
(Genesis,40,8,And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.~)
(Genesis,40,9,And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;~)
(Genesis,40,10,And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:~)
(Genesis,40,11,And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.~)
(Genesis,40,12,And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:~)
(Genesis,40,13,Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.~)
(Genesis,40,14,But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:~)
(Genesis,40,15,For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.~)
(Genesis,40,16,When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:~)
(Genesis,40,17,And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.~)
(Genesis,40,18,And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:~)
(Genesis,40,19,Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.~)
(Genesis,40,20,And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.~)
(Genesis,40,21,And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:~)
(Genesis,40,22,But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.~)
(Genesis,40,23,Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.~)
(Genesis,41,1,And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.~)
(Genesis,41,2,And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.~)
(Genesis,41,3,And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.~)
(Genesis,41,4,And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.~)
(Genesis,41,5,And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.~)
(Genesis,41,6,And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.~)
(Genesis,41,7,And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.~)
(Genesis,41,8,And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.~)
(Genesis,41,9,Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:~)
(Genesis,41,10,Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:~)
(Genesis,41,11,And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.~)
(Genesis,41,12,And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.~)
(Genesis,41,13,And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.~)
(Genesis,41,14,Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.~)
(Genesis,41,15,And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.~)
(Genesis,41,16,And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.~)
(Genesis,41,17,And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:~)
(Genesis,41,18,And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:~)
(Genesis,41,19,And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:~)
(Genesis,41,20,And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:~)
(Genesis,41,21,And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.~)
(Genesis,41,22,And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:~)
(Genesis,41,23,And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:~)
(Genesis,41,24,And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.~)
(Genesis,41,25,And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.~)
(Genesis,41,26,The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.~)
(Genesis,41,27,And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.~)
(Genesis,41,28,This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.~)
(Genesis,41,29,Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:~)
(Genesis,41,30,And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;~)
(Genesis,41,31,And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.~)
(Genesis,41,32,And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.~)
(Genesis,41,33,Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.~)
(Genesis,41,34,Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.~)
(Genesis,41,35,And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.~)
(Genesis,41,36,And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.~)

(1 Chronicles,21,16,And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.~)

(1 Chronicles,21,22,Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.~)
(1 Chronicles,21,23,And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.~)
(1 Chronicles,21,24,And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.~)

(1 Chronicles,22,17,David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,~)

(Haggai,1,2,Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built.~)
(Haggai,1,3,Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,~)
(Haggai,1,4,Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?~)
(Haggai,1,5,Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.~)
(Haggai,1,6,Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.~)

(Haggai,1,10,Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.~)
(Haggai,1,11,And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.~)

(Haggai,2,10,In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,~)
(Haggai,2,11,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,~)

(Haggai,2,14,Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.~)
(Haggai,2,15,And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:~)
(Haggai,2,16,Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.~)
(Haggai,2,17,I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.~)
(Haggai,2,18,Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.~)
(Haggai,2,19,Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.~)

(Haggai,2,21,Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;~)
(Haggai,2,22,And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.~)
(Haggai,2,23,In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,1,1,The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.~)
(Malachi,1,2,I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,~)
(Malachi,1,3,And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.~)
(Malachi,1,4,Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.~)
(Malachi,1,5,And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.~)
(Malachi,1,6,A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?~)
(Malachi,1,7,Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.~)
(Malachi,1,8,And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,1,9,And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,1,10,Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.~)
(Malachi,1,11,For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,1,12,But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.~)
(Malachi,1,13,Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.~)
(Malachi,1,14,But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.~)
(Malachi,2,1,And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.~)
(Malachi,2,2,If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.~)
(Malachi,2,3,Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it.~)
(Malachi,2,4,And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,2,5,My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.~)
(Malachi,2,6,The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.~)
(Malachi,2,7,For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,2,8,But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,2,9,Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.~)
(Malachi,2,10,Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?~)
(Malachi,2,11,Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.~)
(Malachi,2,12,The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,2,13,And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand.~)
(Malachi,2,14,Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.~)
(Malachi,2,15,And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.~)
(Malachi,2,16,For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.~)
(Malachi,2,17,Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?~)
(Malachi,3,1,Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,3,2,But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:~)
(Malachi,3,3,And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.~)
(Malachi,3,4,Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.~)
(Malachi,3,5,And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,3,6,For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.~)
(Malachi,3,7,Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?~)
(Malachi,3,8,Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.~)
(Malachi,3,9,Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation.~)
(Malachi,3,10,Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.~)
(Malachi,3,11,And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,3,12,And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,3,13,Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee?~)
(Malachi,3,14,Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts?~)
(Malachi,3,15,And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.~)
(Malachi,3,16,Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name.~)
(Malachi,3,17,And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.~)
(Malachi,3,18,Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.~)
(Malachi,4,1,For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.~)
(Malachi,4,2,But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.~)
(Malachi,4,3,And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Malachi,4,4,Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.~)
(Malachi,4,5,Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:~)
(Malachi,4,6,And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,1,These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,2,(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)~)
(Deuteronomy,1,3,And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;~)
(Deuteronomy,1,4,After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:~)
(Deuteronomy,1,5,On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,~)
(Deuteronomy,1,6,The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:~)
(Deuteronomy,1,7,Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,8,Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,9,And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:~)
(Deuteronomy,1,10,The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,11,(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)~)
(Deuteronomy,1,12,How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?~)
(Deuteronomy,1,13,Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,14,And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,15,So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,16,And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,17,Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,18,And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,19,And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,20,And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,21,Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,22,And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,23,And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:~)
(Deuteronomy,1,24,And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,25,And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,26,Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:~)
(Deuteronomy,1,27,And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,28,Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,29,Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,30,The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;~)
(Deuteronomy,1,31,And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,32,Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,~)
(Deuteronomy,1,33,Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,34,And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,~)
(Deuteronomy,1,35,Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,36,Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,37,Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,38,But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,39,Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,40,But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,41,Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,42,And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,43,So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,44,And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,45,And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.~)
(Deuteronomy,1,46,So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,1,Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,2,And the LORD spake unto me, saying,~)
(Deuteronomy,2,3,Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,4,And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:~)
(Deuteronomy,2,5,Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,6,Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,7,For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,8,And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,9,And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,10,The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;~)
(Deuteronomy,2,11,Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,12,The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,13,Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,14,And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,15,For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,16,So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,~)
(Deuteronomy,2,17,That the LORD spake unto me, saying,~)
(Deuteronomy,2,18,Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:~)
(Deuteronomy,2,19,And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,20,(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;~)
(Deuteronomy,2,21,A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:~)
(Deuteronomy,2,22,As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:~)
(Deuteronomy,2,23,And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)~)
(Deuteronomy,2,24,Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,25,This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,26,And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,~)
(Deuteronomy,2,27,Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,28,Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;~)
(Deuteronomy,2,29,(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,30,But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,31,And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,32,Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,33,And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,34,And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:~)
(Deuteronomy,2,35,Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.~)
(Deuteronomy,2,36,From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:~)
(Deuteronomy,2,37,Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,1,Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,2,And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,3,So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,4,And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,5,All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,6,And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,7,But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,8,And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;~)
(Deuteronomy,3,9,(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)~)
(Deuteronomy,3,10,All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,11,For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,12,And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,13,And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,14,Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,15,And I gave Gilead unto Machir.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,16,And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;~)
(Deuteronomy,3,17,The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,18,And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,19,But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;~)
(Deuteronomy,3,20,Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,21,And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,22,Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,23,And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,~)
(Deuteronomy,3,24,O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?~)
(Deuteronomy,3,25,I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,26,But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,27,Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,28,But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.~)
(Deuteronomy,3,29,So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,1,Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,2,Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,3,Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,4,But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,5,Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,6,Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,7,For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?~)
(Deuteronomy,4,8,And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?~)
(Deuteronomy,4,9,Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;~)
(Deuteronomy,4,10,Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,11,And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,12,And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,13,And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,14,And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,15,Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,16,Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,~)
(Deuteronomy,4,17,The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,~)
(Deuteronomy,4,18,The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,19,And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,20,But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,21,Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,22,But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,23,Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,24,For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,25,When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,26,I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,27,And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,28,And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,29,But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,30,When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;~)
(Deuteronomy,4,31,(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,32,For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?~)
(Deuteronomy,4,33,Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?~)
(Deuteronomy,4,34,Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?~)
(Deuteronomy,4,35,Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,36,Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,37,And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;~)
(Deuteronomy,4,38,To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,39,Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,40,Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,41,Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;~)
(Deuteronomy,4,42,That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,43,Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,44,And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,45,These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt.~)
(Deuteronomy,4,46,On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:~)
(Deuteronomy,4,47,And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising;~)
(Deuteronomy,4,48,From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon,~)

(Deuteronomy,31,21,And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.~)

(2 Corinthians,1,1,Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:~)
(2 Corinthians,1,2,Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,3,Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;~)
(2 Corinthians,1,4,Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,5,For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,6,And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,7,And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,8,For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:~)
(2 Corinthians,1,9,But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:~)
(2 Corinthians,1,10,Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;~)
(2 Corinthians,1,11,Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,12,For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,13,For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;~)
(2 Corinthians,1,14,As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,15,And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;~)
(2 Corinthians,1,16,And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,17,When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?~)
(2 Corinthians,1,18,But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,19,For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,20,For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.~)

(2 Corinthians,1,22,Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,23,Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.~)
(2 Corinthians,1,24,Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,1,But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,2,For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?~)
(2 Corinthians,2,3,And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,4,For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,5,But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,6,Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,7,So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,8,Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,9,For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,10,To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;~)
(2 Corinthians,2,11,Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,12,Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,~)
(2 Corinthians,2,13,I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,14,Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.~)
(2 Corinthians,2,15,For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:~)
(2 Corinthians,2,16,To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?~)
(2 Corinthians,2,17,For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,1,Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?~)
(2 Corinthians,3,2,Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:~)
(2 Corinthians,3,3,Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,4,And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:~)
(2 Corinthians,3,5,Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;~)
(2 Corinthians,3,6,Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,7,But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:~)
(2 Corinthians,3,8,How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?~)
(2 Corinthians,3,9,For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,10,For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,11,For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,12,Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:~)
(2 Corinthians,3,13,And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:~)
(2 Corinthians,3,14,But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,15,But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,16,Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,17,Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.~)
(2 Corinthians,3,18,But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,1,Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;~)
(2 Corinthians,4,2,But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,3,But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:~)
(2 Corinthians,4,4,In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,5,For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,6,For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,7,But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,8,We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;~)
(2 Corinthians,4,9,Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;~)
(2 Corinthians,4,10,Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,11,For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,12,So then death worketh in us, but life in you.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,13,We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;~)
(2 Corinthians,4,14,Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,15,For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,16,For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.~)
(2 Corinthians,4,17,For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;~)
(2 Corinthians,4,18,While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,1,For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,2,For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:~)
(2 Corinthians,5,3,If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,4,For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,5,Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,6,Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:~)
(2 Corinthians,5,7,(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)~)
(2 Corinthians,5,8,We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,9,Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,10,For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,11,Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,12,For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,13,For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,14,For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:~)
(2 Corinthians,5,15,And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,16,Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,17,Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,18,And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;~)
(2 Corinthians,5,19,To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,20,Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.~)
(2 Corinthians,5,21,For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,1,We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,2,(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)~)
(2 Corinthians,6,3,Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:~)
(2 Corinthians,6,4,But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,~)
(2 Corinthians,6,5,In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;~)
(2 Corinthians,6,6,By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,~)
(2 Corinthians,6,7,By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,~)
(2 Corinthians,6,8,By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;~)
(2 Corinthians,6,9,As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;~)
(2 Corinthians,6,10,As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,11,O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,12,Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,13,Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,14,Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?~)
(2 Corinthians,6,15,And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?~)
(2 Corinthians,6,16,And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,17,Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.~)
(2 Corinthians,6,18,And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,1,Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,2,Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,3,I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,4,Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,5,For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,6,Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;~)
(2 Corinthians,7,7,And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,8,For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,9,Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,10,For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,11,For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,12,Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,13,Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,14,For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,15,And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.~)
(2 Corinthians,7,16,I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,1,Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;~)
(2 Corinthians,8,2,How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,3,For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;~)
(2 Corinthians,8,4,Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,5,And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,6,Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,7,Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,8,I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,9,For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,10,And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,11,Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,12,For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,13,For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:~)
(2 Corinthians,8,14,But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:~)
(2 Corinthians,8,15,As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,16,But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,17,For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,18,And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;~)
(2 Corinthians,8,19,And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:~)
(2 Corinthians,8,20,Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:~)
(2 Corinthians,8,21,Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,22,And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,23,Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,8,24,Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,1,For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:~)
(2 Corinthians,9,2,For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,3,Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:~)
(2 Corinthians,9,4,Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,5,Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,6,But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,7,Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,8,And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:~)
(2 Corinthians,9,9,(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,10,Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)~)
(2 Corinthians,9,11,Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,12,For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;~)
(2 Corinthians,9,13,Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;~)
(2 Corinthians,9,14,And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.~)
(2 Corinthians,9,15,Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,1,Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:~)
(2 Corinthians,10,2,But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,3,For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:~)
(2 Corinthians,10,4,(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)~)
(2 Corinthians,10,5,Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;~)
(2 Corinthians,10,6,And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,7,Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,8,For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:~)
(2 Corinthians,10,9,That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,10,For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,11,Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,12,For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,13,But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,14,For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:~)
(2 Corinthians,10,15,Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,~)
(2 Corinthians,10,16,To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,17,But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.~)
(2 Corinthians,10,18,For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,1,Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,2,For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,3,But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,4,For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,5,For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,6,But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,7,Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?~)
(2 Corinthians,11,8,I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,9,And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,10,As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,11,Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,12,But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,13,For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,14,And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,15,Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,16,I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,17,That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,18,Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,19,For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,20,For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,21,I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,23,Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,24,Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,25,Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;~)
(2 Corinthians,11,26,In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;~)
(2 Corinthians,11,27,In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,28,Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,29,Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?~)
(2 Corinthians,11,30,If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,31,The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.~)
(2 Corinthians,11,32,In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:~)
(2 Corinthians,11,33,And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,1,It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,2,I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,3,And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)~)
(2 Corinthians,12,4,How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,5,Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,6,For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,7,And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,8,For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,9,And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,10,Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,11,I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,12,Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,13,For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,14,Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,15,And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,16,But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,17,Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?~)
(2 Corinthians,12,18,I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?~)
(2 Corinthians,12,19,Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.~)
(2 Corinthians,12,20,For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:~)
(2 Corinthians,12,21,And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,1,This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,2,I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:~)
(2 Corinthians,13,3,Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,4,For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,5,Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?~)
(2 Corinthians,13,6,But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,7,Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,8,For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,9,For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,10,Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,11,Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,12,Greet one another with an holy kiss.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints salute you.~)
(2 Corinthians,13,14,The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.~)
(Exodus,1,1,Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.~)
(Exodus,1,2,Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,~)
(Exodus,1,3,Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,~)
(Exodus,1,4,Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.~)

(Exodus,2,19,And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.~)
(Exodus,2,20,And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.~)
(Exodus,2,21,And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.~)

(Joshua,4,3,And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.~)
(Joshua,4,4,Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:~)
(Joshua,4,5,And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:~)
(Joshua,4,6,That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?~)
(Joshua,4,7,Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.~)
(Joshua,4,8,And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.~)
(Joshua,4,9,And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.~)
(Joshua,4,10,For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.~)
(Joshua,4,11,And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.~)
(Joshua,4,12,And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:~)
(Joshua,4,13,About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.~)
(Joshua,4,14,On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.~)
(Joshua,4,15,And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,~)
(Joshua,4,16,Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.~)
(Joshua,4,17,Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.~)
(Joshua,4,18,And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.~)
(Joshua,4,19,And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.~)
(Joshua,4,20,And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.~)
(Joshua,4,21,And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?~)
(Joshua,4,22,Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.~)
(Joshua,4,23,For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:~)
(Joshua,4,24,That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.~)
(Joshua,5,1,And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.~)
(Joshua,5,2,At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.~)
(Joshua,5,3,And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.~)
(Joshua,5,4,And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.~)
(Joshua,5,5,Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.~)
(Joshua,5,6,For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.~)
(Joshua,5,7,And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.~)
(Joshua,5,8,And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.~)
(Joshua,5,9,And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.~)
(Joshua,5,10,And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.~)
(Joshua,5,11,And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.~)
(Joshua,5,12,And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.~)
(Joshua,5,13,And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?~)
(Joshua,5,14,And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant?~)
(Joshua,5,15,And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.~)
(Joshua,6,1,Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.~)
(Joshua,6,2,And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.~)
(Joshua,6,3,And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.~)
(Joshua,6,4,And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.~)
(Joshua,6,5,And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.~)
(Joshua,6,6,And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,6,7,And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,6,8,And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.~)
(Joshua,6,9,And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.~)
(Joshua,6,10,And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.~)
(Joshua,6,11,So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.~)
(Joshua,6,12,And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,6,13,And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.~)
(Joshua,6,14,And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.~)
(Joshua,6,15,And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.~)
(Joshua,6,16,And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.~)
(Joshua,6,17,And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.~)
(Joshua,6,18,And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.~)
(Joshua,6,19,But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,6,20,So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.~)
(Joshua,6,21,And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.~)
(Joshua,6,22,But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.~)
(Joshua,6,23,And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.~)
(Joshua,6,24,And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,6,25,And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.~)
(Joshua,6,26,And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.~)
(Joshua,6,27,So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.~)
(Joshua,7,1,But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.~)
(Joshua,7,2,And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.~)
(Joshua,7,3,And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but few.~)
(Joshua,7,4,So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.~)
(Joshua,7,5,And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.~)
(Joshua,7,6,And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.~)
(Joshua,7,7,And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!~)
(Joshua,7,8,O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!~)
(Joshua,7,9,For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?~)
(Joshua,7,10,And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?~)
(Joshua,7,11,Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.~)
(Joshua,7,12,Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.~)
(Joshua,7,13,Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.~)
(Joshua,7,14,In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.~)
(Joshua,7,15,And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.~)
(Joshua,7,16,So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:~)
(Joshua,7,17,And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:~)
(Joshua,7,18,And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.~)
(Joshua,7,19,And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.~)
(Joshua,7,20,And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:~)
(Joshua,7,21,When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.~)
(Joshua,7,22,So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.~)
(Joshua,7,23,And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.~)
(Joshua,7,24,And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.~)
(Joshua,7,25,And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.~)
(Joshua,7,26,And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.~)
(Joshua,8,1,And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:~)
(Joshua,8,2,And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.~)
(Joshua,8,3,So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.~)
(Joshua,8,4,And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:~)
(Joshua,8,5,And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,~)
(Joshua,8,6,(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.~)
(Joshua,8,7,Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.~)
(Joshua,8,8,And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.~)
(Joshua,8,9,Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.~)
(Joshua,8,10,And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.~)
(Joshua,8,11,And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.~)
(Joshua,8,12,And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.~)
(Joshua,8,13,And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.~)
(Joshua,8,14,And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.~)
(Joshua,8,15,And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.~)
(Joshua,8,16,And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.~)
(Joshua,8,17,And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.~)
(Joshua,8,18,And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.~)
(Joshua,8,19,And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.~)
(Joshua,8,20,And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.~)
(Joshua,8,21,And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.~)
(Joshua,8,22,And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.~)
(Joshua,8,23,And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.~)
(Joshua,8,24,And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.~)
(Joshua,8,25,And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.~)
(Joshua,8,26,For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.~)
(Joshua,8,27,Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.~)
(Joshua,8,28,And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.~)
(Joshua,8,29,And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.~)
(Joshua,8,30,Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,~)
(Joshua,8,31,As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.~)
(Joshua,8,32,And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.~)
(Joshua,8,33,And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.~)
(Joshua,8,34,And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.~)
(Joshua,8,35,There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.~)
(Joshua,9,1,And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;~)
(Joshua,9,2,That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.~)
(Joshua,9,3,And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,~)
(Joshua,9,4,They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;~)
(Joshua,9,5,And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.~)
(Joshua,9,6,And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.~)
(Joshua,9,7,And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?~)
(Joshua,9,8,And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?~)
(Joshua,9,9,And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,~)
(Joshua,9,10,And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.~)
(Joshua,9,11,Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.~)
(Joshua,9,12,This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:~)
(Joshua,9,13,And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.~)
(Joshua,9,14,And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,9,15,And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.~)
(Joshua,9,16,And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.~)
(Joshua,9,17,And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.~)
(Joshua,9,18,And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.~)
(Joshua,9,19,But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.~)
(Joshua,9,20,This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.~)
(Joshua,9,21,And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.~)
(Joshua,9,22,And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?~)
(Joshua,9,23,Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.~)
(Joshua,9,24,And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.~)
(Joshua,9,25,And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.~)
(Joshua,9,26,And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.~)
(Joshua,9,27,And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.~)
(Joshua,10,1,Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;~)
(Joshua,10,2,That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.~)
(Joshua,10,3,Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,~)
(Joshua,10,4,Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.~)
(Joshua,10,5,Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.~)
(Joshua,10,6,And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.~)
(Joshua,10,7,So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.~)
(Joshua,10,8,And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.~)
(Joshua,10,9,Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.~)
(Joshua,10,10,And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.~)
(Joshua,10,11,And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.~)
(Joshua,10,12,Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.~)
(Joshua,10,13,And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.~)
(Joshua,10,14,And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.~)
(Joshua,10,15,And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.~)
(Joshua,10,16,But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.~)
(Joshua,10,17,And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.~)
(Joshua,10,18,And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:~)
(Joshua,10,19,And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.~)
(Joshua,10,20,And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.~)
(Joshua,10,21,And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.~)
(Joshua,10,22,Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.~)
(Joshua,10,23,And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.~)
(Joshua,10,24,And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.~)
(Joshua,10,25,And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.~)
(Joshua,10,26,And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.~)
(Joshua,10,27,And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.~)
(Joshua,10,28,And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.~)
(Joshua,10,29,Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:~)
(Joshua,10,30,And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.~)
(Joshua,10,31,And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:~)
(Joshua,10,32,And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.~)
(Joshua,10,33,Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.~)
(Joshua,10,34,And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:~)
(Joshua,10,35,And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.~)
(Joshua,10,36,And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:~)
(Joshua,10,37,And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.~)
(Joshua,10,38,And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:~)
(Joshua,10,39,And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.~)
(Joshua,10,40,So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.~)
(Joshua,10,41,And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.~)
(Joshua,10,42,And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.~)
(Joshua,10,43,And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.~)
(Joshua,11,1,And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,~)
(Joshua,11,2,And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,~)
(Joshua,11,3,And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.~)
(Joshua,11,4,And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.~)
(Joshua,11,5,And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.~)
(Joshua,11,6,And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.~)
(Joshua,11,7,So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.~)
(Joshua,11,8,And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.~)
(Joshua,11,9,And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.~)
(Joshua,11,10,And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.~)
(Joshua,11,11,And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.~)
(Joshua,11,12,And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.~)
(Joshua,11,13,But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.~)
(Joshua,11,14,And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.~)
(Joshua,11,15,As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.~)
(Joshua,11,16,So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;~)
(Joshua,11,17,Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.~)
(Joshua,11,18,Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.~)
(Joshua,11,19,There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.~)
(Joshua,11,20,For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.~)
(Joshua,11,21,And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.~)
(Joshua,11,22,There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.~)
(Joshua,11,23,So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.~)
(Joshua,12,1,Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:~)
(Joshua,12,2,Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;~)
(Joshua,12,3,And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:~)
(Joshua,12,4,And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,~)
(Joshua,12,5,And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.~)
(Joshua,12,6,Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.~)
(Joshua,12,7,And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;~)
(Joshua,12,8,In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:~)

(Joshua,13,1,Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.~)
(Joshua,13,2,This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,~)
(Joshua,13,3,From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:~)
(Joshua,13,4,From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:~)

(Joshua,13,6,All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.~)
(Joshua,13,7,Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,~)
(Joshua,13,8,With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;~)

(Joshua,13,13,Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.~)
(Joshua,13,14,Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.~)
(Joshua,13,15,And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.~)
(Joshua,13,16,And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;~)
(Joshua,13,17,Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,~)

(Joshua,13,32,These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.~)
(Joshua,13,33,But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.~)
(Joshua,14,1,And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.~)
(Joshua,14,2,By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.~)
(Joshua,14,3,For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.~)
(Joshua,14,4,For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.~)
(Joshua,14,5,As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.~)
(Joshua,14,6,Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.~)
(Joshua,14,7,Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.~)
(Joshua,14,8,Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.~)
(Joshua,14,9,And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.~)
(Joshua,14,10,And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.~)
(Joshua,14,11,As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.~)
(Joshua,14,12,Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.~)
(Joshua,14,13,And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.~)
(Joshua,14,14,Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.~)
(Joshua,14,15,And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.~)
(Joshua,15,1,This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.~)
(Joshua,15,2,And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:~)
(Joshua,15,3,And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:~)
(Joshua,15,4,From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.~)
(Joshua,15,5,And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:~)
(Joshua,15,6,And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:~)
(Joshua,15,7,And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:~)
(Joshua,15,8,And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:~)
(Joshua,15,9,And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:~)
(Joshua,15,10,And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:~)
(Joshua,15,11,And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.~)
(Joshua,15,12,And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.~)
(Joshua,15,13,And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.~)
(Joshua,15,14,And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.~)
(Joshua,15,15,And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.~)
(Joshua,15,16,And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.~)
(Joshua,15,17,And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.~)
(Joshua,15,18,And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?~)
(Joshua,15,19,Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.~)
(Joshua,15,20,This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.~)

(Joshua,17,16,And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.~)
(Joshua,17,17,And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:~)

(Joshua,18,6,Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God.~)
(Joshua,18,7,But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.~)
(Joshua,18,8,And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.~)

(Joshua,22,13,And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,~)
(Joshua,22,14,And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.~)
(Joshua,22,15,And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,~)
(Joshua,22,16,Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD?~)
(Joshua,22,17,Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD,~)
(Joshua,22,18,But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.~)
(Joshua,22,19,Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.~)
(Joshua,22,20,Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.~)
(Joshua,22,21,Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,~)
(Joshua,22,22,The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)~)
(Joshua,22,23,That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;~)
(Joshua,22,24,And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?~)
(Joshua,22,25,For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD.~)
(Joshua,22,26,Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:~)
(Joshua,22,27,But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.~)
(Joshua,22,28,Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you.~)
(Joshua,22,29,God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.~)
(Joshua,22,30,And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.~)
(Joshua,22,31,And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,22,32,And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.~)
(Joshua,22,33,And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.~)
(Joshua,22,34,And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.~)
(Joshua,23,1,And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.~)
(Joshua,23,2,And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:~)
(Joshua,23,3,And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.~)
(Joshua,23,4,Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.~)
(Joshua,23,5,And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.~)
(Joshua,23,6,Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;~)
(Joshua,23,7,That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:~)
(Joshua,23,8,But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.~)
(Joshua,23,9,For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.~)
(Joshua,23,10,One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.~)
(Joshua,23,11,Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.~)
(Joshua,23,12,Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:~)
(Joshua,23,13,Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.~)
(Joshua,23,14,And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.~)
(Joshua,23,15,Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.~)
(Joshua,23,16,When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.~)
(Joshua,24,1,And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.~)
(Joshua,24,2,And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.~)
(Joshua,24,3,And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.~)
(Joshua,24,4,And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.~)
(Joshua,24,5,I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.~)
(Joshua,24,6,And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.~)
(Joshua,24,7,And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.~)
(Joshua,24,8,And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.~)
(Joshua,24,9,Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:~)
(Joshua,24,10,But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.~)
(Joshua,24,11,And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.~)
(Joshua,24,12,And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.~)
(Joshua,24,13,And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.~)
(Joshua,24,14,Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.~)
(Joshua,24,15,And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.~)
(Joshua,24,16,And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;~)
(Joshua,24,17,For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:~)
(Joshua,24,18,And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD; for he is our God.~)
(Joshua,24,19,And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.~)
(Joshua,24,20,If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.~)
(Joshua,24,21,And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD.~)
(Joshua,24,22,And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witnesses.~)
(Joshua,24,23,Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.~)
(Joshua,24,24,And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.~)
(Joshua,24,25,So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.~)
(Joshua,24,26,And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.~)
(Joshua,24,27,And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.~)
(Joshua,24,28,So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.~)
(Joshua,24,29,And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.~)
(Joshua,24,30,And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.~)
(Joshua,24,31,And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.~)
(Joshua,24,32,And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.~)
(Joshua,24,33,And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.~)
(2 Samuel,1,1,Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;~)
(2 Samuel,1,2,It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.~)
(2 Samuel,1,3,And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.~)
(2 Samuel,1,4,And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.~)
(2 Samuel,1,5,And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?~)
(2 Samuel,1,6,And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.~)
(2 Samuel,1,7,And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.~)
(2 Samuel,1,8,And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.~)
(2 Samuel,1,9,He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.~)
(2 Samuel,1,10,So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.~)
(2 Samuel,1,11,Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:~)
(2 Samuel,1,12,And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.~)
(2 Samuel,1,13,And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.~)
(2 Samuel,1,14,And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?~)
(2 Samuel,1,15,And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.~)
(2 Samuel,1,16,And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.~)
(2 Samuel,1,17,And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:~)
(2 Samuel,1,18,(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)~)
(2 Samuel,1,19,The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!~)
(2 Samuel,1,20,Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.~)
(2 Samuel,1,21,Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.~)
(2 Samuel,1,22,From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.~)
(2 Samuel,1,23,Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.~)
(2 Samuel,1,24,Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.~)
(2 Samuel,1,25,How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.~)
(2 Samuel,1,26,I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.~)
(2 Samuel,1,27,How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!~)
(2 Samuel,2,1,And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,2,2,So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.~)
(2 Samuel,2,3,And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,2,4,And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.~)
(2 Samuel,2,5,And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.~)
(2 Samuel,2,6,And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.~)
(2 Samuel,2,7,Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.~)
(2 Samuel,2,8,But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;~)
(2 Samuel,2,9,And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,2,10,Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.~)
(2 Samuel,2,11,And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.~)
(2 Samuel,2,12,And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.~)
(2 Samuel,2,13,And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.~)
(2 Samuel,2,14,And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.~)
(2 Samuel,2,15,Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.~)
(2 Samuel,2,16,And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.~)
(2 Samuel,2,17,And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.~)
(2 Samuel,2,18,And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.~)
(2 Samuel,2,19,And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.~)
(2 Samuel,2,20,Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.~)
(2 Samuel,2,21,And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.~)
(2 Samuel,2,22,And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?~)
(2 Samuel,2,23,Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.~)
(2 Samuel,2,24,Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.~)
(2 Samuel,2,25,And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.~)
(2 Samuel,2,26,Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?~)
(2 Samuel,2,27,And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.~)
(2 Samuel,2,28,So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.~)
(2 Samuel,2,29,And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.~)
(2 Samuel,2,30,And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.~)
(2 Samuel,2,31,But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.~)
(2 Samuel,2,32,And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.~)
(2 Samuel,3,1,Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.~)
(2 Samuel,3,2,And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;~)
(2 Samuel,3,3,And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;~)
(2 Samuel,3,4,And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;~)
(2 Samuel,3,5,And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,3,6,And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.~)
(2 Samuel,3,7,And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?~)
(2 Samuel,3,8,Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?~)
(2 Samuel,3,9,So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;~)
(2 Samuel,3,10,To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.~)
(2 Samuel,3,11,And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.~)
(2 Samuel,3,12,And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.~)
(2 Samuel,3,13,And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.~)
(2 Samuel,3,14,And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.~)
(2 Samuel,3,15,And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.~)
(2 Samuel,3,16,And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.~)
(2 Samuel,3,17,And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:~)
(2 Samuel,3,18,Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.~)
(2 Samuel,3,19,And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.~)
(2 Samuel,3,20,So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.~)
(2 Samuel,3,21,And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.~)
(2 Samuel,3,22,And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.~)
(2 Samuel,3,23,When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.~)
(2 Samuel,3,24,Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?~)
(2 Samuel,3,25,Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.~)
(2 Samuel,3,26,And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.~)
(2 Samuel,3,27,And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.~)
(2 Samuel,3,28,And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:~)
(2 Samuel,3,29,Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.~)
(2 Samuel,3,30,So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.~)
(2 Samuel,3,31,And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.~)
(2 Samuel,3,32,And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.~)
(2 Samuel,3,33,And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?~)
(2 Samuel,3,34,Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.~)
(2 Samuel,3,35,And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.~)
(2 Samuel,3,36,And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.~)
(2 Samuel,3,37,For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.~)
(2 Samuel,3,38,And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?~)
(2 Samuel,3,39,And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.~)
(2 Samuel,4,1,And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.~)
(2 Samuel,4,2,And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.~)
(2 Samuel,4,3,And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)~)
(2 Samuel,4,4,And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.~)
(2 Samuel,4,5,And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.~)
(2 Samuel,4,6,And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.~)
(2 Samuel,4,7,For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.~)
(2 Samuel,4,8,And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.~)
(2 Samuel,4,9,And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,~)
(2 Samuel,4,10,When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:~)
(2 Samuel,4,11,How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?~)
(2 Samuel,4,12,And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,5,1,Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.~)
(2 Samuel,5,2,Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,5,3,So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,5,4,David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.~)
(2 Samuel,5,5,In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.~)
(2 Samuel,5,6,And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.~)
(2 Samuel,5,7,Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.~)
(2 Samuel,5,8,And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.~)
(2 Samuel,5,9,So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.~)
(2 Samuel,5,10,And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.~)
(2 Samuel,5,11,And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.~)
(2 Samuel,5,12,And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.~)
(2 Samuel,5,13,And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.~)
(2 Samuel,5,14,And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,~)
(2 Samuel,5,15,Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,~)
(2 Samuel,5,16,And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.~)
(2 Samuel,5,17,But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.~)
(2 Samuel,5,18,The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.~)
(2 Samuel,5,19,And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.~)
(2 Samuel,5,20,And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.~)
(2 Samuel,5,21,And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.~)
(2 Samuel,5,22,And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.~)
(2 Samuel,5,23,And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.~)
(2 Samuel,5,24,And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.~)
(2 Samuel,5,25,And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.~)
(2 Samuel,6,1,Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.~)
(2 Samuel,6,2,And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.~)
(2 Samuel,6,3,And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.~)
(2 Samuel,6,4,And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.~)
(2 Samuel,6,5,And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.~)
(2 Samuel,6,6,And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.~)
(2 Samuel,6,7,And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.~)
(2 Samuel,6,8,And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.~)
(2 Samuel,6,9,And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?~)
(2 Samuel,6,10,So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.~)
(2 Samuel,6,11,And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.~)
(2 Samuel,6,12,And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.~)
(2 Samuel,6,13,And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.~)
(2 Samuel,6,14,And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.~)
(2 Samuel,6,15,So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.~)
(2 Samuel,6,16,And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.~)
(2 Samuel,6,17,And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.~)
(2 Samuel,6,18,And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.~)
(2 Samuel,6,19,And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.~)
(2 Samuel,6,20,Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!~)
(2 Samuel,6,21,And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.~)
(2 Samuel,6,22,And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.~)
(2 Samuel,6,23,Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.~)
(2 Samuel,7,1,And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;~)
(2 Samuel,7,2,That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.~)
(2 Samuel,7,3,And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.~)
(2 Samuel,7,4,And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,~)
(2 Samuel,7,5,Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?~)
(2 Samuel,7,6,Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.~)
(2 Samuel,7,7,In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?~)
(2 Samuel,7,8,Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:~)
(2 Samuel,7,9,And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.~)
(2 Samuel,7,10,Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,~)
(2 Samuel,7,11,And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.~)
(2 Samuel,7,12,And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.~)
(2 Samuel,7,13,He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.~)
(2 Samuel,7,14,I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:~)
(2 Samuel,7,15,But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.~)
(2 Samuel,7,16,And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.~)
(2 Samuel,7,17,According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.~)
(2 Samuel,7,18,Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?~)
(2 Samuel,7,19,And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?~)
(2 Samuel,7,20,And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.~)
(2 Samuel,7,21,For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.~)
(2 Samuel,7,22,Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.~)
(2 Samuel,7,23,And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?~)
(2 Samuel,7,24,For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.~)
(2 Samuel,7,25,And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.~)
(2 Samuel,7,26,And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.~)
(2 Samuel,7,27,For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.~)
(2 Samuel,7,28,And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:~)
(2 Samuel,7,29,Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.~)
(2 Samuel,8,1,And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.~)
(2 Samuel,8,2,And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.~)
(2 Samuel,8,3,David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.~)
(2 Samuel,8,4,And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.~)
(2 Samuel,8,5,And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.~)
(2 Samuel,8,6,Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.~)
(2 Samuel,8,7,And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,8,8,And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.~)
(2 Samuel,8,9,When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,~)
(2 Samuel,8,10,Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:~)
(2 Samuel,8,11,Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;~)
(2 Samuel,8,12,Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.~)
(2 Samuel,8,13,And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.~)
(2 Samuel,8,14,And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.~)
(2 Samuel,8,15,And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.~)
(2 Samuel,8,16,And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;~)
(2 Samuel,8,17,And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;~)
(2 Samuel,8,18,And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.~)
(2 Samuel,9,1,And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?~)
(2 Samuel,9,2,And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And he said, Thy servant is he.~)
(2 Samuel,9,3,And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.~)
(2 Samuel,9,4,And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.~)
(2 Samuel,9,5,Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.~)
(2 Samuel,9,6,Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!~)
(2 Samuel,9,7,And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.~)
(2 Samuel,9,8,And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?~)
(2 Samuel,9,9,Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.~)
(2 Samuel,9,10,Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.~)
(2 Samuel,9,11,Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.~)
(2 Samuel,9,12,And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.~)
(2 Samuel,9,13,So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.~)
(2 Samuel,10,1,And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Samuel,10,2,Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.~)
(2 Samuel,10,3,And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?~)
(2 Samuel,10,4,Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.~)
(2 Samuel,10,5,When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.~)
(2 Samuel,10,6,And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.~)
(2 Samuel,10,7,And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.~)
(2 Samuel,10,8,And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.~)
(2 Samuel,10,9,When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:~)
(2 Samuel,10,10,And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.~)
(2 Samuel,10,11,And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.~)
(2 Samuel,10,12,Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.~)
(2 Samuel,10,13,And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.~)
(2 Samuel,10,14,And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,10,15,And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.~)
(2 Samuel,10,16,And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.~)
(2 Samuel,10,17,And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.~)
(2 Samuel,10,18,And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.~)
(2 Samuel,10,19,And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.~)
(2 Samuel,11,1,And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,11,2,And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.~)
(2 Samuel,11,3,And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?~)
(2 Samuel,11,4,And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.~)
(2 Samuel,11,5,And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.~)
(2 Samuel,11,6,And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.~)
(2 Samuel,11,7,And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.~)
(2 Samuel,11,8,And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.~)
(2 Samuel,11,9,But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.~)
(2 Samuel,11,10,And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?~)
(2 Samuel,11,11,And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.~)
(2 Samuel,11,12,And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.~)
(2 Samuel,11,13,And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.~)
(2 Samuel,11,14,And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.~)
(2 Samuel,11,15,And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.~)
(2 Samuel,11,16,And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.~)
(2 Samuel,11,17,And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.~)
(2 Samuel,11,18,Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;~)
(2 Samuel,11,19,And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,~)
(2 Samuel,11,20,And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?~)
(2 Samuel,11,21,Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.~)
(2 Samuel,11,22,So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.~)
(2 Samuel,11,23,And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.~)
(2 Samuel,11,24,And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.~)
(2 Samuel,11,25,Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.~)
(2 Samuel,11,26,And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.~)
(2 Samuel,11,27,And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.~)
(2 Samuel,12,1,And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.~)
(2 Samuel,12,2,The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:~)
(2 Samuel,12,3,But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.~)
(2 Samuel,12,4,And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.~)
(2 Samuel,12,5,And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:~)
(2 Samuel,12,6,And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.~)
(2 Samuel,12,7,And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;~)
(2 Samuel,12,8,And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.~)
(2 Samuel,12,9,Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.~)
(2 Samuel,12,10,Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.~)
(2 Samuel,12,11,Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.~)
(2 Samuel,12,12,For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.~)
(2 Samuel,12,13,And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.~)
(2 Samuel,12,14,Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.~)
(2 Samuel,12,15,And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.~)
(2 Samuel,12,16,David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.~)
(2 Samuel,12,17,And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.~)
(2 Samuel,12,18,And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?~)
(2 Samuel,12,19,But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.~)
(2 Samuel,12,20,Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.~)
(2 Samuel,12,21,Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.~)
(2 Samuel,12,22,And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?~)
(2 Samuel,12,23,But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.~)
(2 Samuel,12,24,And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.~)
(2 Samuel,12,25,And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.~)
(2 Samuel,12,26,And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.~)
(2 Samuel,12,27,And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.~)
(2 Samuel,12,28,Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.~)
(2 Samuel,12,29,And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.~)
(2 Samuel,12,30,And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.~)
(2 Samuel,12,31,And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,13,1,And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.~)
(2 Samuel,13,2,And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.~)
(2 Samuel,13,3,But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.~)
(2 Samuel,13,4,And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.~)
(2 Samuel,13,5,And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.~)
(2 Samuel,13,6,So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.~)
(2 Samuel,13,7,Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.~)
(2 Samuel,13,8,So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.~)
(2 Samuel,13,9,And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.~)
(2 Samuel,13,10,And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.~)
(2 Samuel,13,11,And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.~)
(2 Samuel,13,12,And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.~)
(2 Samuel,13,13,And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.~)
(2 Samuel,13,14,Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.~)
(2 Samuel,13,15,Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.~)
(2 Samuel,13,16,And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.~)
(2 Samuel,13,17,Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.~)
(2 Samuel,13,18,And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.~)
(2 Samuel,13,19,And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.~)
(2 Samuel,13,20,And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.~)
(2 Samuel,13,21,But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.~)
(2 Samuel,13,22,And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.~)
(2 Samuel,13,23,And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.~)
(2 Samuel,13,24,And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.~)
(2 Samuel,13,25,And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.~)
(2 Samuel,13,26,Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?~)
(2 Samuel,13,27,But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.~)
(2 Samuel,13,28,Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.~)
(2 Samuel,13,29,And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.~)
(2 Samuel,13,30,And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.~)
(2 Samuel,13,31,Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.~)
(2 Samuel,13,32,And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.~)
(2 Samuel,13,33,Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.~)
(2 Samuel,13,34,But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.~)
(2 Samuel,13,35,And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.~)
(2 Samuel,13,36,And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.~)
(2 Samuel,13,37,But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.~)
(2 Samuel,13,38,So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.~)
(2 Samuel,13,39,And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.~)
(2 Samuel,14,1,Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,14,2,And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:~)
(2 Samuel,14,3,And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.~)
(2 Samuel,14,4,And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.~)
(2 Samuel,14,5,And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.~)
(2 Samuel,14,6,And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.~)
(2 Samuel,14,7,And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.~)
(2 Samuel,14,8,And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.~)
(2 Samuel,14,9,And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.~)
(2 Samuel,14,10,And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.~)
(2 Samuel,14,11,Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.~)
(2 Samuel,14,12,Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.~)
(2 Samuel,14,13,And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.~)
(2 Samuel,14,14,For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.~)
(2 Samuel,14,15,Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.~)
(2 Samuel,14,16,For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.~)
(2 Samuel,14,17,Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.~)
(2 Samuel,14,18,Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.~)
(2 Samuel,14,19,And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:~)
(2 Samuel,14,20,To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.~)
(2 Samuel,14,21,And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.~)
(2 Samuel,14,22,And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.~)
(2 Samuel,14,23,So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,14,24,And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.~)
(2 Samuel,14,25,But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.~)
(2 Samuel,14,26,And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.~)
(2 Samuel,14,27,And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.~)
(2 Samuel,14,28,So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.~)
(2 Samuel,14,29,Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.~)
(2 Samuel,14,30,Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.~)
(2 Samuel,14,31,Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?~)
(2 Samuel,14,32,And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.~)
(2 Samuel,14,33,So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,15,1,And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.~)
(2 Samuel,15,2,And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,15,3,And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.~)
(2 Samuel,15,4,Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!~)
(2 Samuel,15,5,And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.~)
(2 Samuel,15,6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,15,7,And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,15,8,For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.~)
(2 Samuel,15,9,And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,15,10,But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.~)
(2 Samuel,15,11,And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.~)
(2 Samuel,15,12,And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,15,13,And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,15,14,And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.~)
(2 Samuel,15,15,And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.~)
(2 Samuel,15,16,And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.~)
(2 Samuel,15,17,And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.~)
(2 Samuel,15,18,And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.~)
(2 Samuel,15,19,Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.~)
(2 Samuel,15,20,Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.~)
(2 Samuel,15,21,And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.~)
(2 Samuel,15,22,And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.~)
(2 Samuel,15,23,And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.~)
(2 Samuel,15,24,And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.~)
(2 Samuel,15,25,And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:~)
(2 Samuel,15,26,But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.~)
(2 Samuel,15,27,The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.~)
(2 Samuel,15,28,See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.~)
(2 Samuel,15,29,Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.~)
(2 Samuel,15,30,And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.~)
(2 Samuel,15,31,And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.~)
(2 Samuel,15,32,And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:~)
(2 Samuel,15,33,Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:~)
(2 Samuel,15,34,But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.~)
(2 Samuel,15,35,And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.~)
(2 Samuel,15,36,Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.~)
(2 Samuel,15,37,So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,16,1,And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.~)
(2 Samuel,16,2,And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.~)
(2 Samuel,16,3,And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.~)
(2 Samuel,16,4,Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.~)
(2 Samuel,16,5,And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.~)
(2 Samuel,16,6,And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.~)
(2 Samuel,16,7,And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:~)
(2 Samuel,16,8,The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.~)
(2 Samuel,16,9,Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.~)
(2 Samuel,16,10,And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?~)
(2 Samuel,16,11,And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.~)
(2 Samuel,16,12,It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.~)
(2 Samuel,16,13,And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.~)
(2 Samuel,16,14,And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.~)
(2 Samuel,16,15,And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.~)
(2 Samuel,16,16,And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.~)
(2 Samuel,16,17,And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?~)
(2 Samuel,16,18,And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.~)
(2 Samuel,16,19,And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.~)
(2 Samuel,16,20,Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.~)
(2 Samuel,16,21,And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.~)
(2 Samuel,16,22,So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,16,23,And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,17,1,Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:~)
(2 Samuel,17,2,And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:~)
(2 Samuel,17,3,And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.~)
(2 Samuel,17,4,And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,17,5,Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.~)
(2 Samuel,17,6,And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.~)
(2 Samuel,17,7,And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.~)
(2 Samuel,17,8,For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.~)
(2 Samuel,17,9,Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,17,10,And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.~)
(2 Samuel,17,11,Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.~)
(2 Samuel,17,12,So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.~)
(2 Samuel,17,13,Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.~)
(2 Samuel,17,14,And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,17,15,Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.~)
(2 Samuel,17,16,Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.~)
(2 Samuel,17,17,Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.~)
(2 Samuel,17,18,Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.~)
(2 Samuel,17,19,And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.~)
(2 Samuel,17,20,And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,17,21,And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.~)
(2 Samuel,17,22,Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.~)
(2 Samuel,17,23,And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.~)
(2 Samuel,17,24,Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.~)
(2 Samuel,17,25,And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.~)
(2 Samuel,17,26,So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.~)
(2 Samuel,17,27,And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,~)
(2 Samuel,17,28,Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,~)
(2 Samuel,17,29,And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.~)
(2 Samuel,18,1,And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.~)
(2 Samuel,18,2,And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.~)
(2 Samuel,18,3,But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.~)
(2 Samuel,18,4,And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.~)
(2 Samuel,18,5,And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;~)
(2 Samuel,18,7,Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.~)
(2 Samuel,18,8,For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.~)
(2 Samuel,18,9,And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.~)
(2 Samuel,18,10,And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.~)
(2 Samuel,18,11,And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.~)
(2 Samuel,18,12,And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,18,13,Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.~)
(2 Samuel,18,14,Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.~)
(2 Samuel,18,15,And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.~)
(2 Samuel,18,16,And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.~)
(2 Samuel,18,17,And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.~)
(2 Samuel,18,18,Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.~)
(2 Samuel,18,19,Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.~)
(2 Samuel,18,20,And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.~)
(2 Samuel,18,21,Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.~)
(2 Samuel,18,22,Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?~)
(2 Samuel,18,23,But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.~)
(2 Samuel,18,24,And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.~)
(2 Samuel,18,25,And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.~)
(2 Samuel,18,26,And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.~)
(2 Samuel,18,27,And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.~)
(2 Samuel,18,28,And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.~)
(2 Samuel,18,29,And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.~)
(2 Samuel,18,30,And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.~)
(2 Samuel,18,31,And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.~)
(2 Samuel,18,32,And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.~)
(2 Samuel,18,33,And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!~)
(2 Samuel,19,1,And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,19,2,And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.~)
(2 Samuel,19,3,And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.~)
(2 Samuel,19,4,But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!~)
(2 Samuel,19,5,And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;~)
(2 Samuel,19,6,In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.~)
(2 Samuel,19,7,Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.~)
(2 Samuel,19,8,Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.~)
(2 Samuel,19,9,And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.~)
(2 Samuel,19,10,And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?~)
(2 Samuel,19,11,And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.~)
(2 Samuel,19,12,Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?~)
(2 Samuel,19,13,And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.~)
(2 Samuel,19,14,And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.~)
(2 Samuel,19,15,So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.~)
(2 Samuel,19,16,And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.~)
(2 Samuel,19,17,And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.~)
(2 Samuel,19,18,And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;~)
(2 Samuel,19,19,And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.~)
(2 Samuel,19,20,For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.~)
(2 Samuel,19,21,But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?~)
(2 Samuel,19,22,And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?~)
(2 Samuel,19,23,Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.~)
(2 Samuel,19,24,And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.~)
(2 Samuel,19,25,And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?~)
(2 Samuel,19,26,And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.~)
(2 Samuel,19,27,And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.~)
(2 Samuel,19,28,For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?~)
(2 Samuel,19,29,And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.~)
(2 Samuel,19,30,And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.~)
(2 Samuel,19,31,And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.~)
(2 Samuel,19,32,Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.~)
(2 Samuel,19,33,And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,19,34,And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?~)
(2 Samuel,19,35,I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?~)
(2 Samuel,19,36,Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?~)
(2 Samuel,19,37,Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.~)
(2 Samuel,19,38,And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.~)
(2 Samuel,19,39,And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.~)
(2 Samuel,19,40,Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,19,41,And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?~)
(2 Samuel,19,42,And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?~)
(2 Samuel,19,43,And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,20,1,And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,20,2,So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Samuel,20,3,And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.~)
(2 Samuel,20,4,Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.~)
(2 Samuel,20,5,So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.~)
(2 Samuel,20,6,And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.~)
(2 Samuel,20,7,And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.~)
(2 Samuel,20,8,When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.~)
(2 Samuel,20,9,And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.~)
(2 Samuel,20,10,But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.~)
(2 Samuel,20,11,And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.~)
(2 Samuel,20,12,And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.~)
(2 Samuel,20,13,When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.~)
(2 Samuel,20,14,And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.~)
(2 Samuel,20,15,And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.~)
(2 Samuel,20,16,Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.~)
(2 Samuel,20,17,And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.~)
(2 Samuel,20,18,Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.~)
(2 Samuel,20,19,I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?~)
(2 Samuel,20,20,And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.~)
(2 Samuel,20,21,The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.~)
(2 Samuel,20,22,Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.~)
(2 Samuel,20,23,Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:~)
(2 Samuel,20,24,And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:~)
(2 Samuel,20,25,And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:~)
(2 Samuel,20,26,And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.~)
(2 Samuel,21,1,Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.~)
(2 Samuel,21,2,And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)~)
(2 Samuel,21,3,Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD?~)

(2 Samuel,21,10,And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.~)
(2 Samuel,21,11,And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.~)
(2 Samuel,21,12,And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:~)
(2 Samuel,21,13,And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.~)

(2 Samuel,21,15,Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.~)
(2 Samuel,21,16,And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.~)
(2 Samuel,21,17,But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.~)
(2 Samuel,21,18,And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.~)
(2 Samuel,21,19,And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.~)
(2 Samuel,21,20,And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.~)

(2 Samuel,22,6,The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;~)
(2 Samuel,22,7,In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.~)
(2 Samuel,22,8,Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.~)
(2 Samuel,22,9,There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.~)
(2 Samuel,22,10,He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.~)
(2 Samuel,22,11,And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.~)
(2 Samuel,22,12,And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.~)
(2 Samuel,22,13,Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.~)
(2 Samuel,22,14,The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.~)
(2 Samuel,22,15,And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.~)
(2 Samuel,22,16,And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.~)

(2 Samuel,22,18,He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.~)
(2 Samuel,22,19,They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.~)
(2 Samuel,22,20,He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.~)
(2 Samuel,22,21,The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.~)
(2 Samuel,22,22,For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.~)
(2 Samuel,22,23,For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.~)
(2 Samuel,22,24,I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.~)
(2 Samuel,22,25,Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.~)

(2 Samuel,22,29,For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.~)
(2 Samuel,22,30,For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.~)
(2 Samuel,22,31,As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.~)

(2 Samuel,22,37,Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.~)
(2 Samuel,22,38,I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.~)
(2 Samuel,22,39,And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.~)
(2 Samuel,22,40,For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.~)
(2 Samuel,22,41,Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.~)
(2 Samuel,22,42,They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.~)
(2 Samuel,22,43,Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.~)
(2 Samuel,22,44,Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.~)
(2 Samuel,22,45,Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.~)

(2 Samuel,22,51,He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.~)

(Romans,1,12,That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.~)
(Romans,1,13,Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.~)
(Romans,1,14,I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.~)
(Romans,1,15,So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.~)
(Romans,1,16,For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.~)
(Romans,1,17,For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.~)
(Romans,1,18,For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;~)
(Romans,1,19,Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.~)
(Romans,1,20,For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:~)
(Romans,1,21,Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.~)
(Romans,1,22,Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,~)
(Romans,1,23,And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.~)
(Romans,1,24,Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:~)
(Romans,1,25,Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.~)
(Romans,1,26,For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:~)
(Romans,1,27,And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.~)
(Romans,1,28,And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;~)
(Romans,1,29,Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,~)
(Romans,1,30,Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,~)
(Romans,1,31,Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:~)
(Romans,1,32,Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.~)
(Romans,2,1,Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.~)
(Romans,2,2,But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.~)
(Romans,2,3,And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?~)
(Romans,2,4,Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?~)
(Romans,2,5,But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;~)
(Romans,2,6,Who will render to every man according to his deeds:~)
(Romans,2,7,To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:~)
(Romans,2,8,But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,~)
(Romans,2,9,Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;~)
(Romans,2,10,But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:~)
(Romans,2,11,For there is no respect of persons with God.~)
(Romans,2,12,For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;~)
(Romans,2,13,(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.~)
(Romans,2,14,For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:~)
(Romans,2,15,Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)~)
(Romans,2,16,In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.~)
(Romans,2,17,Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,~)
(Romans,2,18,And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;~)
(Romans,2,19,And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,~)
(Romans,2,20,An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.~)
(Romans,2,21,Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?~)
(Romans,2,22,Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?~)
(Romans,2,23,Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?~)
(Romans,2,24,For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.~)
(Romans,2,25,For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.~)
(Romans,2,26,Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?~)
(Romans,2,27,And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?~)
(Romans,2,28,For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:~)
(Romans,2,29,But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.~)
(Romans,3,1,What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?~)
(Romans,3,2,Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.~)
(Romans,3,3,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?~)
(Romans,3,4,God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.~)
(Romans,3,5,But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)~)
(Romans,3,6,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?~)
(Romans,3,7,For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?~)
(Romans,3,8,And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.~)
(Romans,3,9,What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;~)
(Romans,3,10,As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:~)
(Romans,3,11,There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.~)
(Romans,3,12,They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.~)
(Romans,3,13,Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:~)
(Romans,3,14,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:~)
(Romans,3,15,Their feet are swift to shed blood:~)
(Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery are in their ways:~)
(Romans,3,17,And the way of peace have they not known:~)
(Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.~)
(Romans,3,19,Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.~)
(Romans,3,20,Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.~)
(Romans,3,21,But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;~)
(Romans,3,22,Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:~)
(Romans,3,23,For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;~)
(Romans,3,24,Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:~)
(Romans,3,25,Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;~)
(Romans,3,26,To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.~)
(Romans,3,27,Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.~)
(Romans,3,28,Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.~)
(Romans,3,29,Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:~)
(Romans,3,30,Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.~)
(Romans,3,31,Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.~)
(Romans,4,1,What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?~)
(Romans,4,2,For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.~)
(Romans,4,3,For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.~)
(Romans,4,4,Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.~)
(Romans,4,5,But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.~)
(Romans,4,6,Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,~)
(Romans,4,7,Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.~)
(Romans,4,8,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.~)
(Romans,4,9,Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.~)
(Romans,4,10,How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.~)
(Romans,4,11,And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:~)
(Romans,4,12,And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.~)
(Romans,4,13,For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.~)
(Romans,4,14,For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:~)
(Romans,4,15,Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.~)
(Romans,4,16,Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,~)
(Romans,4,17,(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.~)
(Romans,4,18,Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.~)
(Romans,4,19,And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:~)
(Romans,4,20,He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;~)
(Romans,4,21,And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.~)
(Romans,4,22,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.~)
(Romans,4,23,Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;~)
(Romans,4,24,But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;~)
(Romans,4,25,Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.~)
(Romans,5,1,Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:~)
(Romans,5,2,By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.~)
(Romans,5,3,And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;~)
(Romans,5,4,And patience, experience; and experience, hope:~)
(Romans,5,5,And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.~)
(Romans,5,6,For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.~)
(Romans,5,7,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.~)
(Romans,5,8,But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.~)
(Romans,5,9,Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.~)
(Romans,5,10,For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.~)
(Romans,5,11,And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.~)
(Romans,5,12,Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:~)
(Romans,5,13,(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.~)
(Romans,5,14,Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.~)
(Romans,5,15,But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.~)
(Romans,5,16,And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.~)
(Romans,5,17,For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)~)
(Romans,5,18,Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.~)
(Romans,5,19,For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.~)
(Romans,5,20,Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:~)
(Romans,5,21,That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.~)
(Romans,6,1,What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?~)
(Romans,6,2,God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?~)
(Romans,6,3,Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?~)
(Romans,6,4,Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.~)
(Romans,6,5,For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:~)
(Romans,6,6,Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.~)
(Romans,6,7,For he that is dead is freed from sin.~)
(Romans,6,8,Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:~)
(Romans,6,9,Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.~)
(Romans,6,10,For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.~)
(Romans,6,11,Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.~)
(Romans,6,12,Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.~)
(Romans,6,13,Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.~)
(Romans,6,14,For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.~)
(Romans,6,15,What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.~)
(Romans,6,16,Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?~)
(Romans,6,17,But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.~)
(Romans,6,18,Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.~)
(Romans,6,19,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.~)
(Romans,6,20,For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.~)
(Romans,6,21,What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.~)
(Romans,6,22,But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.~)
(Romans,6,23,For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.~)
(Romans,7,1,Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?~)
(Romans,7,2,For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.~)
(Romans,7,3,So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.~)
(Romans,7,4,Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.~)
(Romans,7,5,For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.~)
(Romans,7,6,But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.~)
(Romans,7,7,What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.~)
(Romans,7,8,But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.~)
(Romans,7,9,For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.~)
(Romans,7,10,And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.~)
(Romans,7,11,For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.~)
(Romans,7,12,Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.~)
(Romans,7,13,Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.~)
(Romans,7,14,For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.~)
(Romans,7,15,For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.~)
(Romans,7,16,If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.~)
(Romans,7,17,Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.~)
(Romans,7,18,For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.~)
(Romans,7,19,For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.~)
(Romans,7,20,Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.~)
(Romans,7,21,I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.~)
(Romans,7,22,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:~)
(Romans,7,23,But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.~)
(Romans,7,24,O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?~)
(Romans,7,25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.~)
(Romans,8,1,There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.~)
(Romans,8,2,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.~)
(Romans,8,3,For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:~)
(Romans,8,4,That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.~)
(Romans,8,5,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.~)
(Romans,8,6,For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.~)
(Romans,8,7,Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.~)
(Romans,8,8,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.~)
(Romans,8,9,But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.~)
(Romans,8,10,And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.~)
(Romans,8,11,But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.~)
(Romans,8,12,Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.~)
(Romans,8,13,For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.~)
(Romans,8,14,For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.~)
(Romans,8,15,For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.~)
(Romans,8,16,The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:~)
(Romans,8,17,And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.~)
(Romans,8,18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.~)
(Romans,8,19,For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.~)
(Romans,8,20,For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,~)
(Romans,8,21,Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.~)
(Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.~)
(Romans,8,23,And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.~)
(Romans,8,24,For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?~)
(Romans,8,25,But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.~)
(Romans,8,26,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.~)
(Romans,8,27,And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.~)
(Romans,8,28,And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.~)
(Romans,8,29,For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.~)
(Romans,8,30,Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.~)
(Romans,8,31,What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?~)
(Romans,8,32,He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?~)
(Romans,8,33,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.~)
(Romans,8,34,Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.~)
(Romans,8,35,Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?~)
(Romans,8,36,As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.~)
(Romans,8,37,Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.~)
(Romans,8,38,For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,~)
(Romans,8,39,Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.~)
(Romans,9,1,I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,~)
(Romans,9,2,That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.~)
(Romans,9,3,For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:~)
(Romans,9,4,Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;~)
(Romans,9,5,Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.~)
(Romans,9,6,Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:~)
(Romans,9,7,Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.~)
(Romans,9,8,That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.~)
(Romans,9,9,For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.~)
(Romans,9,10,And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;~)
(Romans,9,11,(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)~)
(Romans,9,12,It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.~)
(Romans,9,13,As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.~)
(Romans,9,14,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.~)
(Romans,9,15,For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.~)
(Romans,9,16,So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.~)
(Romans,9,17,For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.~)
(Romans,9,18,Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.~)
(Romans,9,19,Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?~)
(Romans,9,20,Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?~)
(Romans,9,21,Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?~)
(Romans,9,22,What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:~)
(Romans,9,23,And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,~)
(Romans,9,24,Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?~)
(Romans,9,25,As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.~)
(Romans,9,26,And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.~)
(Romans,9,27,Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:~)
(Romans,9,28,For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.~)
(Romans,9,29,And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.~)
(Romans,9,30,What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.~)
(Romans,9,31,But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.~)
(Romans,9,32,Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;~)
(Romans,9,33,As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.~)
(Romans,10,1,Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.~)
(Romans,10,2,For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.~)
(Romans,10,3,For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.~)
(Romans,10,4,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.~)
(Romans,10,5,For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.~)
(Romans,10,6,But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)~)
(Romans,10,7,Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)~)
(Romans,10,8,But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;~)
(Romans,10,9,That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.~)
(Romans,10,10,For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.~)
(Romans,10,11,For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.~)
(Romans,10,12,For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.~)
(Romans,10,13,For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.~)
(Romans,10,14,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?~)
(Romans,10,15,And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!~)
(Romans,10,16,But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?~)
(Romans,10,17,So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.~)
(Romans,10,18,But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.~)
(Romans,10,19,But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.~)
(Romans,10,20,But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.~)
(Romans,10,21,But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.~)
(Romans,11,1,I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.~)
(Romans,11,2,God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,~)
(Romans,11,3,Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.~)
(Romans,11,4,But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.~)
(Romans,11,5,Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.~)
(Romans,11,6,And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.~)
(Romans,11,7,What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.~)
(Romans,11,8,(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.~)
(Romans,11,9,And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:~)
(Romans,11,10,Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.~)
(Romans,11,11,I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.~)
(Romans,11,12,Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?~)
(Romans,11,13,For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:~)
(Romans,11,14,If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.~)
(Romans,11,15,For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?~)
(Romans,11,16,For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.~)
(Romans,11,17,And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;~)
(Romans,11,18,Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.~)
(Romans,11,19,Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.~)
(Romans,11,20,Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:~)
(Romans,11,21,For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.~)
(Romans,11,22,Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.~)
(Romans,11,23,And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.~)
(Romans,11,24,For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?~)
(Romans,11,25,For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.~)
(Romans,11,26,And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:~)
(Romans,11,27,For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.~)
(Romans,11,28,As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.~)
(Romans,11,29,For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.~)
(Romans,11,30,For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:~)
(Romans,11,31,Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.~)
(Romans,11,32,For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.~)
(Romans,11,33,O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!~)
(Romans,11,34,For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?~)
(Romans,11,35,Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?~)
(Romans,11,36,For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.~)
(Romans,12,1,I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.~)
(Romans,12,2,And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.~)
(Romans,12,3,For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.~)
(Romans,12,4,For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:~)
(Romans,12,5,So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.~)
(Romans,12,6,Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;~)
(Romans,12,7,Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;~)
(Romans,12,8,Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.~)
(Romans,12,9,Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.~)
(Romans,12,10,Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;~)
(Romans,12,11,Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;~)
(Romans,12,12,Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;~)
(Romans,12,13,Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.~)
(Romans,12,14,Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.~)
(Romans,12,15,Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.~)
(Romans,12,16,Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.~)
(Romans,12,17,Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.~)
(Romans,12,18,If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.~)
(Romans,12,19,Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.~)
(Romans,12,20,Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.~)
(Romans,12,21,Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.~)
(Romans,13,1,Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.~)
(Romans,13,2,Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.~)
(Romans,13,3,For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:~)
(Romans,13,4,For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.~)
(Romans,13,5,Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.~)
(Romans,13,6,For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.~)
(Romans,13,7,Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.~)
(Romans,13,8,Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.~)
(Romans,13,9,For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.~)
(Romans,13,10,Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.~)
(Romans,13,11,And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.~)
(Romans,13,12,The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.~)
(Romans,13,13,Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.~)
(Romans,13,14,But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.~)
(Romans,14,1,Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.~)
(Romans,14,2,For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.~)
(Romans,14,3,Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.~)
(Romans,14,4,Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.~)
(Romans,14,5,One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.~)
(Romans,14,6,He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.~)
(Romans,14,7,For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.~)
(Romans,14,8,For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.~)
(Romans,14,9,For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.~)
(Romans,14,10,But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.~)
(Romans,14,11,For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.~)
(Romans,14,12,So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.~)
(Romans,14,13,Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.~)
(Romans,14,14,I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.~)
(Romans,14,15,But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.~)
(Romans,14,16,Let not then your good be evil spoken of:~)
(Romans,14,17,For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.~)
(Romans,14,18,For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.~)
(Romans,14,19,Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.~)
(Romans,14,20,For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.~)
(Romans,14,21,It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.~)
(Romans,14,22,Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.~)
(Romans,14,23,And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.~)
(Romans,15,1,We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.~)
(Romans,15,2,Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.~)
(Romans,15,3,For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.~)
(Romans,15,4,For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.~)
(Romans,15,5,Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:~)
(Romans,15,6,That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Romans,15,7,Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.~)
(Romans,15,8,Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:~)
(Romans,15,9,And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.~)
(Romans,15,10,And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.~)
(Romans,15,11,And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.~)
(Romans,15,12,And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.~)
(Romans,15,13,Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.~)
(Romans,15,14,And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.~)
(Romans,15,15,Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,~)
(Romans,15,16,That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.~)
(Romans,15,17,I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.~)
(Romans,15,18,For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,~)
(Romans,15,19,Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.~)
(Romans,15,20,Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:~)
(Romans,15,21,But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.~)
(Romans,15,22,For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.~)
(Romans,15,23,But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;~)
(Romans,15,24,Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.~)
(Romans,15,25,But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.~)
(Romans,15,26,For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.~)
(Romans,15,27,It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.~)
(Romans,15,28,When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.~)
(Romans,15,29,And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.~)
(Romans,15,30,Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;~)
(Romans,15,31,That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;~)
(Romans,15,32,That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.~)
(Romans,15,33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.~)
(Romans,16,1,I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:~)
(Romans,16,2,That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.~)
(Romans,16,3,Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:~)
(Romans,16,4,Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.~)
(Romans,16,5,Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.~)
(Romans,16,6,Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.~)
(Romans,16,7,Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.~)
(Romans,16,8,Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.~)
(Romans,16,9,Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.~)
(Romans,16,10,Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.~)
(Romans,16,11,Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.~)
(Romans,16,12,Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.~)
(Romans,16,13,Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.~)
(Romans,16,14,Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.~)
(Romans,16,15,Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.~)
(Romans,16,16,Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.~)
(Romans,16,17,Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.~)
(Romans,16,18,For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.~)
(Romans,16,19,For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.~)
(Romans,16,20,And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.~)
(Romans,16,21,Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.~)
(Romans,16,22,I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.~)
(Romans,16,23,Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.~)
(Romans,16,24,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.~)
(Romans,16,25,Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,~)
(Romans,16,26,But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:~)
(Romans,16,27,To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.~)
(2 Kings,1,1,Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.~)
(2 Kings,1,2,And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.~)
(2 Kings,1,3,But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?~)
(2 Kings,1,4,Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.~)
(2 Kings,1,5,And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?~)
(2 Kings,1,6,And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.~)
(2 Kings,1,7,And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?~)
(2 Kings,1,8,And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.~)
(2 Kings,1,9,Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.~)
(2 Kings,1,10,And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.~)
(2 Kings,1,11,Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.~)
(2 Kings,1,12,And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.~)
(2 Kings,1,13,And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.~)
(2 Kings,1,14,Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.~)
(2 Kings,1,15,And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.~)
(2 Kings,1,16,And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.~)
(2 Kings,1,17,So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.~)
(2 Kings,1,18,Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(2 Kings,2,1,And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.~)
(2 Kings,2,2,And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.~)
(2 Kings,2,3,And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.~)
(2 Kings,2,4,And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.~)
(2 Kings,2,5,And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.~)
(2 Kings,2,6,And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.~)
(2 Kings,2,7,And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.~)
(2 Kings,2,8,And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.~)
(2 Kings,2,9,And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.~)
(2 Kings,2,10,And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.~)
(2 Kings,2,11,And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.~)
(2 Kings,2,12,And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.~)
(2 Kings,2,13,He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;~)
(2 Kings,2,14,And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over.~)
(2 Kings,2,15,And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.~)
(2 Kings,2,16,And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.~)
(2 Kings,2,17,And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.~)
(2 Kings,2,18,And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?~)
(2 Kings,2,19,And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.~)
(2 Kings,2,20,And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.~)
(2 Kings,2,21,And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.~)
(2 Kings,2,22,So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.~)
(2 Kings,2,23,And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.~)
(2 Kings,2,24,And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.~)
(2 Kings,2,25,And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.~)
(2 Kings,3,1,Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.~)
(2 Kings,3,2,And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.~)
(2 Kings,3,3,Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.~)
(2 Kings,3,4,And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.~)
(2 Kings,3,5,But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,3,6,And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.~)
(2 Kings,3,7,And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.~)
(2 Kings,3,8,And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.~)
(2 Kings,3,9,So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.~)
(2 Kings,3,10,And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!~)
(2 Kings,3,11,But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.~)
(2 Kings,3,12,And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.~)
(2 Kings,3,13,And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.~)
(2 Kings,3,14,And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.~)
(2 Kings,3,15,But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.~)
(2 Kings,3,16,And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.~)
(2 Kings,3,17,For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.~)
(2 Kings,3,18,And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.~)
(2 Kings,3,19,And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.~)
(2 Kings,3,20,And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.~)
(2 Kings,3,21,And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border.~)
(2 Kings,3,22,And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:~)
(2 Kings,3,23,And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.~)
(2 Kings,3,24,And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.~)
(2 Kings,3,25,And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.~)
(2 Kings,3,26,And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.~)
(2 Kings,3,27,Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.~)
(2 Kings,4,1,Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.~)
(2 Kings,4,2,And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.~)
(2 Kings,4,3,Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.~)
(2 Kings,4,4,And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.~)
(2 Kings,4,5,So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.~)
(2 Kings,4,6,And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.~)
(2 Kings,4,7,Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.~)
(2 Kings,4,8,And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.~)
(2 Kings,4,9,And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.~)
(2 Kings,4,10,Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.~)
(2 Kings,4,11,And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.~)
(2 Kings,4,12,And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.~)
(2 Kings,4,13,And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.~)
(2 Kings,4,14,And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.~)
(2 Kings,4,15,And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.~)
(2 Kings,4,16,And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.~)
(2 Kings,4,17,And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.~)
(2 Kings,4,18,And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.~)
(2 Kings,4,19,And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.~)
(2 Kings,4,20,And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.~)
(2 Kings,4,21,And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.~)
(2 Kings,4,22,And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.~)
(2 Kings,4,23,And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.~)
(2 Kings,4,24,Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.~)
(2 Kings,4,25,So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:~)
(2 Kings,4,26,Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:~)
(2 Kings,4,27,And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.~)
(2 Kings,4,28,Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?~)
(2 Kings,4,29,Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.~)
(2 Kings,4,30,And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.~)
(2 Kings,4,31,And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.~)
(2 Kings,4,32,And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed.~)
(2 Kings,4,33,He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,4,34,And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.~)
(2 Kings,4,35,Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.~)
(2 Kings,4,36,And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.~)
(2 Kings,4,37,Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.~)
(2 Kings,4,38,And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.~)
(2 Kings,4,39,And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.~)
(2 Kings,4,40,So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.~)
(2 Kings,4,41,But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.~)
(2 Kings,4,42,And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat.~)
(2 Kings,4,43,And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?  He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.~)
(2 Kings,4,44,So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,5,1,Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.~)
(2 Kings,5,2,And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife.~)
(2 Kings,5,3,And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.~)
(2 Kings,5,4,And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,5,5,And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.~)
(2 Kings,5,6,And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.~)
(2 Kings,5,7,And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me.~)
(2 Kings,5,8,And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.~)
(2 Kings,5,9,So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.~)
(2 Kings,5,10,And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.~)
(2 Kings,5,11,But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.~)
(2 Kings,5,12,Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.~)
(2 Kings,5,13,And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?~)
(2 Kings,5,14,Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.~)
(2 Kings,5,15,And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.~)
(2 Kings,5,16,But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.~)
(2 Kings,5,17,And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,5,18,In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.~)
(2 Kings,5,19,And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.~)
(2 Kings,5,20,But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.~)
(2 Kings,5,21,So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?~)
(2 Kings,5,22,And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.~)
(2 Kings,5,23,And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.~)
(2 Kings,5,24,And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.~)
(2 Kings,5,25,But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.~)
(2 Kings,5,26,And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?~)
(2 Kings,5,27,The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.~)
(2 Kings,6,1,And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.~)
(2 Kings,6,2,Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye.~)
(2 Kings,6,3,And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.~)
(2 Kings,6,4,So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.~)
(2 Kings,6,5,But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.~)
(2 Kings,6,6,And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.~)
(2 Kings,6,7,Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.~)
(2 Kings,6,8,Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.~)
(2 Kings,6,9,And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.~)
(2 Kings,6,10,And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.~)
(2 Kings,6,11,Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?~)
(2 Kings,6,12,And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.~)
(2 Kings,6,13,And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.~)
(2 Kings,6,14,Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.~)
(2 Kings,6,15,And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?~)
(2 Kings,6,16,And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.~)
(2 Kings,6,17,And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.~)
(2 Kings,6,18,And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.~)
(2 Kings,6,19,And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.~)
(2 Kings,6,20,And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.~)
(2 Kings,6,21,And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?~)
(2 Kings,6,22,And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.~)
(2 Kings,6,23,And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,6,24,And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.~)
(2 Kings,6,25,And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.~)
(2 Kings,6,26,And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.~)
(2 Kings,6,27,And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?  out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?~)
(2 Kings,6,28,And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.~)
(2 Kings,6,29,So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.~)
(2 Kings,6,30,And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.~)
(2 Kings,6,31,Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.~)
(2 Kings,6,32,But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?~)
(2 Kings,6,33,And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?~)
(2 Kings,7,1,Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.~)
(2 Kings,7,2,Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.~)
(2 Kings,7,3,And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?~)
(2 Kings,7,4,If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.~)
(2 Kings,7,5,And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.~)
(2 Kings,7,6,For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.~)
(2 Kings,7,7,Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.~)
(2 Kings,7,8,And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.~)
(2 Kings,7,9,Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.~)
(2 Kings,7,10,So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.~)
(2 Kings,7,11,And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.~)
(2 Kings,7,12,And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.~)
(2 Kings,7,13,And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see.~)
(2 Kings,7,14,They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.~)
(2 Kings,7,15,And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.~)
(2 Kings,7,16,And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,7,17,And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.~)
(2 Kings,7,18,And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria:~)
(2 Kings,7,19,And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.~)
(2 Kings,7,20,And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.~)
(2 Kings,8,1,Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.~)
(2 Kings,8,2,And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.~)
(2 Kings,8,3,And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.~)
(2 Kings,8,4,And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.~)
(2 Kings,8,5,And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.~)
(2 Kings,8,6,And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now.~)
(2 Kings,8,7,And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.~)
(2 Kings,8,8,And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?~)
(2 Kings,8,9,So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?~)
(2 Kings,8,10,And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.~)
(2 Kings,8,11,And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.~)
(2 Kings,8,12,And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.~)
(2 Kings,8,13,And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.~)
(2 Kings,8,14,So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover.~)
(2 Kings,8,15,And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,8,16,And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.~)
(2 Kings,8,17,Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.~)
(2 Kings,8,18,And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,8,19,Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.~)
(2 Kings,8,20,In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.~)
(2 Kings,8,21,So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.~)
(2 Kings,8,22,Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.~)
(2 Kings,8,23,And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(2 Kings,8,24,And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,8,25,In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.~)
(2 Kings,8,26,Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,8,27,And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab.~)
(2 Kings,8,28,And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.~)
(2 Kings,8,29,And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.~)
(2 Kings,9,1,And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:~)
(2 Kings,9,2,And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;~)
(2 Kings,9,3,Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.~)
(2 Kings,9,4,So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.~)
(2 Kings,9,5,And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.~)
(2 Kings,9,6,And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.~)
(2 Kings,9,7,And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.~)
(2 Kings,9,8,For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:~)
(2 Kings,9,9,And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:~)
(2 Kings,9,10,And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.~)
(2 Kings,9,11,Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.~)
(2 Kings,9,12,And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.~)
(2 Kings,9,13,Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.~)
(2 Kings,9,14,So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.~)
(2 Kings,9,15,But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.~)
(2 Kings,9,16,So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.~)
(2 Kings,9,17,And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?~)
(2 Kings,9,18,So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.~)
(2 Kings,9,19,Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.~)
(2 Kings,9,20,And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.~)
(2 Kings,9,21,And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.~)
(2 Kings,9,22,And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?~)
(2 Kings,9,23,And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.~)
(2 Kings,9,24,And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.~)
(2 Kings,9,25,Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;~)
(2 Kings,9,26,Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,9,27,But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.~)
(2 Kings,9,28,And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.~)
(2 Kings,9,29,And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.~)
(2 Kings,9,30,And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.~)
(2 Kings,9,31,And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?~)
(2 Kings,9,32,And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.~)
(2 Kings,9,33,And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.~)
(2 Kings,9,34,And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.~)
(2 Kings,9,35,And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.~)
(2 Kings,9,36,Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:~)
(2 Kings,9,37,And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.~)
(2 Kings,10,1,And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,~)
(2 Kings,10,2,Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;~)
(2 Kings,10,3,Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.~)
(2 Kings,10,4,But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?~)
(2 Kings,10,5,And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.~)
(2 Kings,10,6,Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.~)
(2 Kings,10,7,And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.~)
(2 Kings,10,8,And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.~)
(2 Kings,10,9,And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?~)
(2 Kings,10,10,Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.~)
(2 Kings,10,11,So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.~)
(2 Kings,10,12,And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,~)
(2 Kings,10,13,Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.~)
(2 Kings,10,14,And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.~)
(2 Kings,10,15,And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.~)
(2 Kings,10,16,And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.~)
(2 Kings,10,17,And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.~)
(2 Kings,10,18,And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.~)
(2 Kings,10,19,Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.~)
(2 Kings,10,20,And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.~)
(2 Kings,10,21,And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.~)
(2 Kings,10,22,And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.~)
(2 Kings,10,23,And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.~)
(2 Kings,10,24,And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.~)
(2 Kings,10,25,And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.~)
(2 Kings,10,26,And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.~)
(2 Kings,10,27,And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.~)
(2 Kings,10,28,Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,10,29,Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.~)
(2 Kings,10,30,And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,10,31,But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.~)
(2 Kings,10,32,In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;~)
(2 Kings,10,33,From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.~)
(2 Kings,10,34,Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?~)
(2 Kings,10,35,And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,10,36,And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.~)
(2 Kings,11,1,And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.~)
(2 Kings,11,2,But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.~)
(2 Kings,11,3,And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land.~)
(2 Kings,11,4,And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son.~)
(2 Kings,11,5,And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;~)
(2 Kings,11,6,And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down.~)
(2 Kings,11,7,And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.~)
(2 Kings,11,8,And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.~)
(2 Kings,11,9,And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.~)
(2 Kings,11,10,And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,11,11,And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.~)

(2 Kings,17,17,And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.~)
(2 Kings,17,18,Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.~)
(2 Kings,17,19,Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.~)
(2 Kings,17,20,And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.~)
(2 Kings,17,21,For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.~)
(2 Kings,17,22,For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;~)
(2 Kings,17,23,Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.~)
(2 Kings,17,24,And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.~)
(2 Kings,17,25,And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them.~)
(2 Kings,17,26,Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.~)
(2 Kings,17,27,Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.~)
(2 Kings,17,28,Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,17,29,Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.~)
(2 Kings,17,30,And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,~)
(2 Kings,17,31,And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.~)
(2 Kings,17,32,So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.~)
(2 Kings,17,33,They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.~)
(2 Kings,17,34,Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;~)
(2 Kings,17,35,With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:~)
(2 Kings,17,36,But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.~)
(2 Kings,17,37,And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.~)
(2 Kings,17,38,And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.~)
(2 Kings,17,39,But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies.~)
(2 Kings,17,40,Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner.~)
(2 Kings,17,41,So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.~)
(2 Kings,18,1,Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.~)
(2 Kings,18,2,Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.~)
(2 Kings,18,3,And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did.~)
(2 Kings,18,4,He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.~)
(2 Kings,18,5,He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.~)
(2 Kings,18,6,For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.~)
(2 Kings,18,7,And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.~)
(2 Kings,18,8,He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.~)
(2 Kings,18,9,And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.~)
(2 Kings,18,10,And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken.~)
(2 Kings,18,11,And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes:~)
(2 Kings,18,12,Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.~)
(2 Kings,18,13,Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.~)
(2 Kings,18,14,And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.~)
(2 Kings,18,15,And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.~)
(2 Kings,18,16,At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.~)
(2 Kings,18,17,And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.~)
(2 Kings,18,18,And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.~)
(2 Kings,18,19,And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest?~)
(2 Kings,18,20,Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me?~)
(2 Kings,18,21,Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.~)
(2 Kings,18,22,But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?~)
(2 Kings,18,23,Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.~)
(2 Kings,18,24,How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?~)
(2 Kings,18,25,Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it?  The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.~)
(2 Kings,18,26,Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.~)
(2 Kings,18,27,But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?~)
(2 Kings,18,28,Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria:~)
(2 Kings,18,29,Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:~)
(2 Kings,18,30,Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.~)
(2 Kings,18,31,Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:~)
(2 Kings,18,32,Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.~)
(2 Kings,18,33,Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?~)
(2 Kings,18,34,Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand?~)
(2 Kings,18,35,Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?~)
(2 Kings,18,36,But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.~)
(2 Kings,18,37,Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.~)
(2 Kings,19,1,And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,19,2,And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.~)
(2 Kings,19,3,And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.~)
(2 Kings,19,4,It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.~)
(2 Kings,19,5,So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.~)
(2 Kings,19,6,And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.~)
(2 Kings,19,7,Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.~)
(2 Kings,19,8,So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.~)
(2 Kings,19,9,And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,~)
(2 Kings,19,10,Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.~)
(2 Kings,19,11,Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?~)
(2 Kings,19,12,Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?~)
(2 Kings,19,13,Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?~)
(2 Kings,19,14,And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,19,15,And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.~)
(2 Kings,19,16,LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.~)
(2 Kings,19,17,Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,~)
(2 Kings,19,18,And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.~)
(2 Kings,19,19,Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.~)
(2 Kings,19,20,Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.~)
(2 Kings,19,21,This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.~)
(2 Kings,19,22,Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,19,23,By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.~)
(2 Kings,19,24,I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.~)
(2 Kings,19,25,Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.~)
(2 Kings,19,26,Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.~)
(2 Kings,19,27,But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.~)
(2 Kings,19,28,Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.~)
(2 Kings,19,29,And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.~)
(2 Kings,19,30,And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.~)
(2 Kings,19,31,For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.~)
(2 Kings,19,32,Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.~)
(2 Kings,19,33,By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,19,34,For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.~)
(2 Kings,19,35,And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.~)
(2 Kings,19,36,So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.~)
(2 Kings,19,37,And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,20,1,In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.~)
(2 Kings,20,2,Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying,~)
(2 Kings,20,3,I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.~)
(2 Kings,20,4,And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,~)
(2 Kings,20,5,Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,20,6,And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.~)
(2 Kings,20,7,And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.~)
(2 Kings,20,8,And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?~)
(2 Kings,20,9,And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?~)
(2 Kings,20,10,And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.~)
(2 Kings,20,11,And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.~)
(2 Kings,20,12,At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.~)
(2 Kings,20,13,And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.~)
(2 Kings,20,14,Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,20,15,And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.~)
(2 Kings,20,16,And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,20,17,Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,20,18,And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,20,19,Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?~)
(2 Kings,20,20,And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(2 Kings,20,21,And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,21,1,Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.~)
(2 Kings,21,2,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,21,3,For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.~)
(2 Kings,21,4,And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.~)
(2 Kings,21,5,And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,21,6,And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.~)
(2 Kings,21,7,And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:~)
(2 Kings,21,8,Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.~)
(2 Kings,21,9,But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.~)
(2 Kings,21,10,And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,~)
(2 Kings,21,11,Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:~)
(2 Kings,21,12,Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.~)
(2 Kings,21,13,And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.~)
(2 Kings,21,14,And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;~)
(2 Kings,21,15,Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.~)
(2 Kings,21,16,Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,21,17,Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(2 Kings,21,18,And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,21,19,Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.~)
(2 Kings,21,20,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.~)
(2 Kings,21,21,And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:~)
(2 Kings,21,22,And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,21,23,And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.~)
(2 Kings,21,24,And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,21,25,Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(2 Kings,21,26,And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,22,1,Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.~)
(2 Kings,22,2,And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.~)
(2 Kings,22,3,And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,~)
(2 Kings,22,4,Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:~)
(2 Kings,22,5,And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,~)
(2 Kings,22,6,Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.~)
(2 Kings,22,7,Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.~)
(2 Kings,22,8,And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.~)
(2 Kings,22,9,And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,22,10,And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.~)
(2 Kings,22,11,And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.~)
(2 Kings,22,12,And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,~)
(2 Kings,22,13,Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.~)
(2 Kings,22,14,So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.~)
(2 Kings,22,15,And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,~)
(2 Kings,22,16,Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read:~)
(2 Kings,22,17,Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.~)
(2 Kings,22,18,But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;~)
(2 Kings,22,19,Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,22,20,Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.~)
(2 Kings,23,1,And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.~)
(2 Kings,23,2,And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,23,3,And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant.~)
(2 Kings,23,4,And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.~)
(2 Kings,23,5,And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.~)
(2 Kings,23,6,And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.~)
(2 Kings,23,7,And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.~)
(2 Kings,23,8,And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.~)
(2 Kings,23,9,Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren.~)
(2 Kings,23,10,And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.~)
(2 Kings,23,11,And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.~)
(2 Kings,23,12,And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.~)
(2 Kings,23,13,And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.~)
(2 Kings,23,14,And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.~)
(2 Kings,23,15,Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.~)
(2 Kings,23,16,And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.~)
(2 Kings,23,17,Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.~)
(2 Kings,23,18,And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.~)
(2 Kings,23,19,And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.~)
(2 Kings,23,20,And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem.~)
(2 Kings,23,21,And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.~)
(2 Kings,23,22,Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;~)
(2 Kings,23,23,But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.~)
(2 Kings,23,24,Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD.~)
(2 Kings,23,25,And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.~)
(2 Kings,23,26,Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.~)
(2 Kings,23,27,And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.~)
(2 Kings,23,28,Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(2 Kings,23,29,In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.~)
(2 Kings,23,30,And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.~)
(2 Kings,23,31,Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.~)
(2 Kings,23,32,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.~)
(2 Kings,23,33,And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.~)
(2 Kings,23,34,And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.~)
(2 Kings,23,35,And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.~)
(2 Kings,23,36,Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.~)
(2 Kings,23,37,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.~)
(2 Kings,24,1,In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.~)
(2 Kings,24,2,And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.~)
(2 Kings,24,3,Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did;~)
(2 Kings,24,4,And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.~)
(2 Kings,24,5,Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?~)
(2 Kings,24,6,So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.~)
(2 Kings,24,7,And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.~)
(2 Kings,24,8,Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.~)
(2 Kings,24,9,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done.~)
(2 Kings,24,10,At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.~)
(2 Kings,24,11,And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it.~)
(2 Kings,24,12,And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.~)
(2 Kings,24,13,And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.~)
(2 Kings,24,14,And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.~)
(2 Kings,24,15,And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,24,16,And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,24,17,And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.~)
(2 Kings,24,18,Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.~)
(2 Kings,24,19,And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.~)
(2 Kings,24,20,For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,25,1,And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.~)
(2 Kings,25,2,And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.~)
(2 Kings,25,3,And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.~)
(2 Kings,25,4,And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.~)
(2 Kings,25,5,And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.~)
(2 Kings,25,6,So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.~)
(2 Kings,25,7,And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,25,8,And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:~)
(2 Kings,25,9,And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.~)
(2 Kings,25,10,And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.~)
(2 Kings,25,11,Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.~)
(2 Kings,25,12,But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.~)
(2 Kings,25,13,And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.~)
(2 Kings,25,14,And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.~)
(2 Kings,25,15,And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.~)
(2 Kings,25,16,The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.~)
(2 Kings,25,17,The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.~)
(2 Kings,25,18,And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:~)
(2 Kings,25,19,And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city:~)
(2 Kings,25,20,And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:~)
(2 Kings,25,21,And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.~)
(2 Kings,25,22,And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.~)
(2 Kings,25,23,And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.~)
(2 Kings,25,24,And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.~)
(2 Kings,25,25,But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.~)
(2 Kings,25,26,And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.~)
(2 Kings,25,27,And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;~)
(2 Kings,25,28,And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;~)
(2 Kings,25,29,And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life.~)
(2 Kings,25,30,And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.~)

(Song of Solomon,5,5,I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.~)
(Song of Solomon,5,6,I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.~)

(Luke,6,7,And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.~)
(Luke,6,8,But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.~)

(Luke,6,19,And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.~)
(Luke,6,20,And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,6,21,Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.~)
(Luke,6,22,Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.~)
(Luke,6,23,Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.~)
(Luke,6,24,But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.~)
(Luke,6,25,Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.~)

(Luke,6,31,And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.~)
(Luke,6,32,For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them.~)
(Luke,6,33,And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?  for sinners also do even the same.~)
(Luke,6,34,And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.~)
(Luke,6,35,But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.~)
(Luke,6,36,Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.~)
(Luke,6,37,Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:~)

(Luke,6,41,And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?~)
(Luke,6,42,Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.~)
(Luke,6,43,For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.~)
(Luke,6,44,For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.~)
(Luke,6,45,A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.~)
(Luke,6,46,And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?~)
(Luke,6,47,Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:~)
(Luke,6,48,He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.~)
(Luke,6,49,But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.~)
(Luke,7,1,Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.~)

(Luke,7,3,And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.~)
(Luke,7,4,And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:~)
(Luke,7,5,For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.~)
(Luke,7,6,Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:~)
(Luke,7,7,Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.~)
(Luke,7,8,For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.~)
(Luke,7,9,When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.~)
(Luke,7,10,And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.~)
(Luke,7,11,And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.~)
(Luke,7,12,Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.~)
(Luke,7,13,And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.~)
(Luke,7,14,And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.~)
(Luke,7,15,And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.~)
(Luke,7,16,And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.~)
(Luke,7,17,And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.~)
(Luke,7,18,And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.~)
(Luke,7,19,And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?~)
(Luke,7,20,When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?~)
(Luke,7,21,And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.~)
(Luke,7,22,Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.~)
(Luke,7,23,And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.~)
(Luke,7,24,And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?  A reed shaken with the wind?~)
(Luke,7,25,But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.~)
(Luke,7,26,But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.~)
(Luke,7,27,This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.~)
(Luke,7,28,For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.~)
(Luke,7,29,And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.~)
(Luke,7,30,But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.~)
(Luke,7,31,And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?~)
(Luke,7,32,They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.~)
(Luke,7,33,For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.~)
(Luke,7,34,The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!~)
(Luke,7,35,But wisdom is justified of all her children.~)
(Luke,7,36,And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.~)
(Luke,7,37,And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,~)
(Luke,7,38,And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.~)
(Luke,7,39,Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.~)
(Luke,7,40,And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.~)
(Luke,7,41,There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.~)
(Luke,7,42,And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?~)
(Luke,7,43,Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.~)
(Luke,7,44,And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.~)
(Luke,7,45,Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.~)
(Luke,7,46,My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.~)
(Luke,7,47,Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.~)
(Luke,7,48,And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.~)
(Luke,7,49,And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?~)
(Luke,7,50,And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.~)
(Luke,8,1,And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,~)
(Luke,8,2,And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,~)
(Luke,8,3,And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.~)
(Luke,8,4,And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:~)
(Luke,8,5,A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.~)
(Luke,8,6,And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.~)
(Luke,8,7,And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.~)
(Luke,8,8,And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.~)
(Luke,8,9,And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?~)
(Luke,8,10,And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.~)
(Luke,8,11,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.~)
(Luke,8,12,Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.~)
(Luke,8,13,They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.~)
(Luke,8,14,And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.~)
(Luke,8,15,But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.~)
(Luke,8,16,No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.~)
(Luke,8,17,For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.~)
(Luke,8,18,Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.~)
(Luke,8,19,Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.~)
(Luke,8,20,And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.~)
(Luke,8,21,And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.~)
(Luke,8,22,Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.~)
(Luke,8,23,But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.~)
(Luke,8,24,And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.~)
(Luke,8,25,And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.~)
(Luke,8,26,And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.~)
(Luke,8,27,And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.~)
(Luke,8,28,When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.~)
(Luke,8,29,(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)~)
(Luke,8,30,And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.~)
(Luke,8,31,And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.~)
(Luke,8,32,And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.~)
(Luke,8,33,Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.~)
(Luke,8,34,When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.~)
(Luke,8,35,Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.~)
(Luke,8,36,They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.~)
(Luke,8,37,Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.~)
(Luke,8,38,Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,~)
(Luke,8,39,Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.~)
(Luke,8,40,And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.~)
(Luke,8,41,And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:~)
(Luke,8,42,For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.~)
(Luke,8,43,And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,~)
(Luke,8,44,Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.~)
(Luke,8,45,And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?~)
(Luke,8,46,And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.~)
(Luke,8,47,And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.~)
(Luke,8,48,And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.~)
(Luke,8,49,While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.~)
(Luke,8,50,But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.~)
(Luke,8,51,And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.~)
(Luke,8,52,And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.~)
(Luke,8,53,And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.~)
(Luke,8,54,And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.~)
(Luke,8,55,And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.~)
(Luke,8,56,And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.~)
(Luke,9,1,Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.~)
(Luke,9,2,And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.~)
(Luke,9,3,And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.~)
(Luke,9,4,And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart.~)
(Luke,9,5,And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.~)
(Luke,9,6,And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.~)
(Luke,9,7,Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;~)
(Luke,9,8,And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.~)
(Luke,9,9,And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.~)
(Luke,9,10,And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.~)
(Luke,9,11,And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.~)
(Luke,9,12,And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.~)
(Luke,9,13,But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.~)
(Luke,9,14,For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.~)
(Luke,9,15,And they did so, and made them all sit down.~)
(Luke,9,16,Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.~)
(Luke,9,17,And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.~)
(Luke,9,18,And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?~)
(Luke,9,19,They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.~)
(Luke,9,20,He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.~)
(Luke,9,21,And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;~)
(Luke,9,22,Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.~)
(Luke,9,23,And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.~)
(Luke,9,24,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.~)
(Luke,9,25,For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?~)
(Luke,9,26,For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.~)
(Luke,9,27,But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,9,28,And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.~)
(Luke,9,29,And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.~)
(Luke,9,30,And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:~)
(Luke,9,31,Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.~)
(Luke,9,32,But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.~)
(Luke,9,33,And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.~)
(Luke,9,34,While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.~)
(Luke,9,35,And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.~)
(Luke,9,36,And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.~)
(Luke,9,37,And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.~)
(Luke,9,38,And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.~)
(Luke,9,39,And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.~)
(Luke,9,40,And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.~)
(Luke,9,41,And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.~)
(Luke,9,42,And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.~)
(Luke,9,43,And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,~)
(Luke,9,44,Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.~)
(Luke,9,45,But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.~)
(Luke,9,46,Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.~)
(Luke,9,47,And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,~)
(Luke,9,48,And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.~)
(Luke,9,49,And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.~)
(Luke,9,50,And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.~)
(Luke,9,51,And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,~)
(Luke,9,52,And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.~)
(Luke,9,53,And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.~)
(Luke,9,54,And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?~)
(Luke,9,55,But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.~)
(Luke,9,56,For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.~)
(Luke,9,57,And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.~)
(Luke,9,58,And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.~)
(Luke,9,59,And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.~)
(Luke,9,60,Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,9,61,And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.~)
(Luke,9,62,And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,10,1,After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come.~)
(Luke,10,2,Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.~)
(Luke,10,3,Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.~)
(Luke,10,4,Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.~)
(Luke,10,5,And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.~)
(Luke,10,6,And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again.~)
(Luke,10,7,And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.~)
(Luke,10,8,And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:~)
(Luke,10,9,And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.~)
(Luke,10,10,But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,~)
(Luke,10,11,Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.~)
(Luke,10,12,But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.~)
(Luke,10,13,Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.~)
(Luke,10,14,But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.~)
(Luke,10,15,And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.~)
(Luke,10,16,He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.~)
(Luke,10,17,And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.~)
(Luke,10,18,And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.~)
(Luke,10,19,Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.~)
(Luke,10,20,Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.~)
(Luke,10,21,In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.~)
(Luke,10,22,All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.~)
(Luke,10,23,And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:~)
(Luke,10,24,For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.~)
(Luke,10,25,And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?~)
(Luke,10,26,He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?~)
(Luke,10,27,And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.~)
(Luke,10,28,And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.~)
(Luke,10,29,But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?~)
(Luke,10,30,And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.~)
(Luke,10,31,And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.~)
(Luke,10,32,And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.~)
(Luke,10,33,But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,~)
(Luke,10,34,And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.~)
(Luke,10,35,And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.~)
(Luke,10,36,Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?~)
(Luke,10,37,And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.~)
(Luke,10,38,Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.~)
(Luke,10,39,And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.~)
(Luke,10,40,But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone?  bid her therefore that she help me.~)
(Luke,10,41,And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:~)
(Luke,10,42,But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.~)
(Luke,11,1,And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.~)
(Luke,11,2,And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.~)
(Luke,11,3,Give us day by day our daily bread.~)
(Luke,11,4,And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.~)
(Luke,11,5,And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;~)
(Luke,11,6,For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?~)
(Luke,11,7,And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.~)
(Luke,11,8,I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.~)
(Luke,11,9,And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.~)
(Luke,11,10,For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.~)
(Luke,11,11,If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?~)
(Luke,11,12,Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?~)
(Luke,11,13,If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?~)
(Luke,11,14,And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.~)
(Luke,11,15,But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.~)
(Luke,11,16,And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.~)
(Luke,11,17,But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth.~)
(Luke,11,18,If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.~)
(Luke,11,19,And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.~)
(Luke,11,20,But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.~)
(Luke,11,21,When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:~)
(Luke,11,22,But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.~)
(Luke,11,23,He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.~)
(Luke,11,24,When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.~)
(Luke,11,25,And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.~)
(Luke,11,26,Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.~)
(Luke,11,27,And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.~)
(Luke,11,28,But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.~)
(Luke,11,29,And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.~)
(Luke,11,30,For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.~)
(Luke,11,31,The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.~)
(Luke,11,32,The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.~)
(Luke,11,33,No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.~)
(Luke,11,34,The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.~)
(Luke,11,35,Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.~)
(Luke,11,36,If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light.~)
(Luke,11,37,And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.~)
(Luke,11,38,And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.~)
(Luke,11,39,And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.~)
(Luke,11,40,Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?~)
(Luke,11,41,But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.~)
(Luke,11,42,But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.~)
(Luke,11,43,Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.~)
(Luke,11,44,Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.~)
(Luke,11,45,Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.~)
(Luke,11,46,And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.~)
(Luke,11,47,Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.~)
(Luke,11,48,Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.~)
(Luke,11,49,Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:~)
(Luke,11,50,That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;~)
(Luke,11,51,From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.~)
(Luke,11,52,Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.~)
(Luke,11,53,And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:~)
(Luke,11,54,Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.~)
(Luke,12,1,In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.~)

(Luke,14,27,And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.~)
(Luke,14,28,For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?~)
(Luke,14,29,Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,~)
(Luke,14,30,Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.~)

(Luke,15,5,And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.~)
(Luke,15,6,And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.~)
(Luke,15,7,I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.~)
(Luke,15,8,Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?~)
(Luke,15,9,And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.~)
(Luke,15,10,Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.~)
(Luke,15,11,And he said, A certain man had two sons:~)
(Luke,15,12,And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living.~)
(Luke,15,13,And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.~)
(Luke,15,14,And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.~)
(Luke,15,15,And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.~)
(Luke,15,16,And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.~)

(Luke,15,19,And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.~)
(Luke,15,20,And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.~)
(Luke,15,21,And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.~)
(Luke,15,22,But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:~)
(Luke,15,23,And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:~)
(Luke,15,24,For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.~)
(Luke,15,25,Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.~)
(Luke,15,26,And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.~)
(Luke,15,27,And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.~)
(Luke,15,28,And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.~)
(Luke,15,29,And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:~)
(Luke,15,30,But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.~)
(Luke,15,31,And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.~)
(Luke,15,32,It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.~)
(Luke,16,1,And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.~)
(Luke,16,2,And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.~)
(Luke,16,3,Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.~)
(Luke,16,4,I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.~)
(Luke,16,5,So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?~)
(Luke,16,6,And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.~)
(Luke,16,7,Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.~)
(Luke,16,8,And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.~)
(Luke,16,9,And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.~)
(Luke,16,10,He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.~)
(Luke,16,11,If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?~)
(Luke,16,12,And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?~)
(Luke,16,13,No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.~)
(Luke,16,14,And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.~)
(Luke,16,15,And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.~)

(Luke,16,20,And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,~)
(Luke,16,21,And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.~)
(Luke,16,22,And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;~)
(Luke,16,23,And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.~)
(Luke,16,24,And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.~)
(Luke,16,25,But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.~)
(Luke,16,26,And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.~)
(Luke,16,27,Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:~)
(Luke,16,28,For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.~)
(Luke,16,29,Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.~)
(Luke,16,30,And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.~)
(Luke,16,31,And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.~)

(Luke,17,3,Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.~)
(Luke,17,4,And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.~)
(Luke,17,5,And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.~)
(Luke,17,6,And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.~)
(Luke,17,7,But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?~)
(Luke,17,8,And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?~)
(Luke,17,9,Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.~)
(Luke,17,10,So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.~)
(Luke,17,11,And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.~)
(Luke,17,12,And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:~)
(Luke,17,13,And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.~)
(Luke,17,14,And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.~)
(Luke,17,15,And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,~)
(Luke,17,16,And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.~)
(Luke,17,17,And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?~)
(Luke,17,18,There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.~)
(Luke,17,19,And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.~)
(Luke,17,20,And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:~)
(Luke,17,21,Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.~)
(Luke,17,22,And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.~)
(Luke,17,23,And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.~)
(Luke,17,24,For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.~)
(Luke,17,25,But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.~)
(Luke,17,26,And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.~)
(Luke,17,27,They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.~)
(Luke,17,28,Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;~)
(Luke,17,29,But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.~)
(Luke,17,30,Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.~)
(Luke,17,31,In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.~)
(Luke,17,32,Remember Lot's wife.~)
(Luke,17,33,Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.~)
(Luke,17,34,I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.~)
(Luke,17,35,Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.~)
(Luke,17,36,Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.~)
(Luke,17,37,And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.~)
(Luke,18,1,And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;~)
(Luke,18,2,Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:~)
(Luke,18,3,And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.~)
(Luke,18,4,And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;~)
(Luke,18,5,Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.~)
(Luke,18,6,And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.~)
(Luke,18,7,And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?~)
(Luke,18,8,I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?~)
(Luke,18,9,And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:~)
(Luke,18,10,Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.~)
(Luke,18,11,The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.~)
(Luke,18,12,I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.~)
(Luke,18,13,And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.~)
(Luke,18,14,I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.~)
(Luke,18,15,And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.~)
(Luke,18,16,But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,18,17,Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.~)
(Luke,18,18,And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?~)
(Luke,18,19,And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.~)
(Luke,18,20,Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.~)
(Luke,18,21,And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.~)
(Luke,18,22,Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.~)
(Luke,18,23,And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.~)
(Luke,18,24,And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!~)
(Luke,18,25,For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,18,26,And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?~)
(Luke,18,27,And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.~)
(Luke,18,28,Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.~)
(Luke,18,29,And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,~)
(Luke,18,30,Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.~)
(Luke,18,31,Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.~)
(Luke,18,32,For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:~)
(Luke,18,33,And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.~)
(Luke,18,34,And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.~)
(Luke,18,35,And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:~)
(Luke,18,36,And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.~)
(Luke,18,37,And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.~)
(Luke,18,38,And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.~)
(Luke,18,39,And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me.~)
(Luke,18,40,And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,~)
(Luke,18,41,Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.~)
(Luke,18,42,And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.~)
(Luke,18,43,And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.~)
(Luke,19,1,And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.~)
(Luke,19,2,And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.~)
(Luke,19,3,And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.~)
(Luke,19,4,And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.~)
(Luke,19,5,And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.~)
(Luke,19,6,And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.~)
(Luke,19,7,And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.~)
(Luke,19,8,And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.~)
(Luke,19,9,And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.~)
(Luke,19,10,For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.~)
(Luke,19,11,And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.~)
(Luke,19,12,He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.~)
(Luke,19,13,And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.~)
(Luke,19,14,But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.~)
(Luke,19,15,And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.~)
(Luke,19,16,Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.~)
(Luke,19,17,And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.~)
(Luke,19,18,And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.~)
(Luke,19,19,And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.~)
(Luke,19,20,And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:~)
(Luke,19,21,For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.~)
(Luke,19,22,And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:~)
(Luke,19,23,Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?~)
(Luke,19,24,And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.~)
(Luke,19,25,(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)~)
(Luke,19,26,For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.~)
(Luke,19,27,But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.~)
(Luke,19,28,And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.~)
(Luke,19,29,And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,~)
(Luke,19,30,Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.~)
(Luke,19,31,And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.~)
(Luke,19,32,And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.~)
(Luke,19,33,And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?~)
(Luke,19,34,And they said, The Lord hath need of him.~)
(Luke,19,35,And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.~)
(Luke,19,36,And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.~)
(Luke,19,37,And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;~)
(Luke,19,38,Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.~)
(Luke,19,39,And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.~)
(Luke,19,40,And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.~)
(Luke,19,41,And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,~)
(Luke,19,42,Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.~)
(Luke,19,43,For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,~)
(Luke,19,44,And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.~)
(Luke,19,45,And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;~)
(Luke,19,46,Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.~)
(Luke,19,47,And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,~)
(Luke,19,48,And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.~)
(Luke,20,1,And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,~)
(Luke,20,2,And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?~)
(Luke,20,3,And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:~)
(Luke,20,4,The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?~)
(Luke,20,5,And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?~)
(Luke,20,6,But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.~)
(Luke,20,7,And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.~)
(Luke,20,8,And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.~)
(Luke,20,9,Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.~)
(Luke,20,10,And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.~)
(Luke,20,11,And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.~)
(Luke,20,12,And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.~)
(Luke,20,13,Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.~)
(Luke,20,14,But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.~)
(Luke,20,15,So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?~)
(Luke,20,16,He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.~)
(Luke,20,17,And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?~)
(Luke,20,18,Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.~)
(Luke,20,19,And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.~)
(Luke,20,20,And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.~)
(Luke,20,21,And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:~)
(Luke,20,22,Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?~)
(Luke,20,23,But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?~)
(Luke,20,24,Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's.~)
(Luke,20,25,And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.~)
(Luke,20,26,And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.~)
(Luke,20,27,Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,~)
(Luke,20,28,Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.~)
(Luke,20,29,There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.~)
(Luke,20,30,And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.~)
(Luke,20,31,And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.~)
(Luke,20,32,Last of all the woman died also.~)
(Luke,20,33,Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.~)
(Luke,20,34,And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:~)
(Luke,20,35,But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:~)
(Luke,20,36,Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.~)
(Luke,20,37,Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.~)
(Luke,20,38,For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.~)
(Luke,20,39,Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.~)
(Luke,20,40,And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.~)
(Luke,20,41,And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son?~)
(Luke,20,42,And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,~)
(Luke,20,43,Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.~)
(Luke,20,44,David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?~)
(Luke,20,45,Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,~)
(Luke,20,46,Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;~)
(Luke,20,47,Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.~)
(Luke,21,1,And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury.~)
(Luke,21,2,And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites.~)
(Luke,21,3,And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all:~)
(Luke,21,4,For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.~)
(Luke,21,5,And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,~)
(Luke,21,6,As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.~)
(Luke,21,7,And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be?  and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?~)
(Luke,21,8,And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them.~)
(Luke,21,9,But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and by.~)
(Luke,21,10,Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:~)
(Luke,21,11,And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.~)
(Luke,21,12,But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake.~)
(Luke,21,13,And it shall turn to you for a testimony.~)
(Luke,21,14,Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:~)
(Luke,21,15,For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.~)
(Luke,21,16,And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.~)
(Luke,21,17,And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.~)
(Luke,21,18,But there shall not an hair of your head perish.~)
(Luke,21,19,In your patience possess ye your souls.~)
(Luke,21,20,And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.~)
(Luke,21,21,Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.~)
(Luke,21,22,For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.~)
(Luke,21,23,But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.~)
(Luke,21,24,And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.~)
(Luke,21,25,And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;~)
(Luke,21,26,Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.~)
(Luke,21,27,And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.~)
(Luke,21,28,And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.~)
(Luke,21,29,And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;~)
(Luke,21,30,When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand.~)
(Luke,21,31,So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.~)
(Luke,21,32,Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all be fulfilled.~)
(Luke,21,33,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.~)
(Luke,21,34,And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.~)
(Luke,21,35,For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.~)
(Luke,21,36,Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.~)
(Luke,21,37,And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.~)
(Luke,21,38,And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him.~)
(Luke,22,1,Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.~)
(Luke,22,2,And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.~)
(Luke,22,3,Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.~)
(Luke,22,4,And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.~)
(Luke,22,5,And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.~)
(Luke,22,6,And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.~)
(Luke,22,7,Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.~)
(Luke,22,8,And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.~)
(Luke,22,9,And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?~)
(Luke,22,10,And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.~)
(Luke,22,11,And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?~)
(Luke,22,12,And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.~)
(Luke,22,13,And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.~)
(Luke,22,14,And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.~)
(Luke,22,15,And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:~)
(Luke,22,16,For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,22,17,And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:~)
(Luke,22,18,For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.~)

(Luke,22,20,Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.~)
(Luke,22,21,But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.~)
(Luke,22,22,And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!~)
(Luke,22,23,And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.~)
(Luke,22,24,And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.~)
(Luke,22,25,And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.~)
(Luke,22,26,But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.~)
(Luke,22,27,For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?  is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.~)
(Luke,22,28,Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.~)
(Luke,22,29,And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;~)

(Luke,22,34,And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.~)
(Luke,22,35,And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.~)
(Luke,22,36,Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.~)
(Luke,22,37,For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.~)
(Luke,22,38,And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.~)
(Luke,22,39,And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.~)
(Luke,22,40,And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.~)
(Luke,22,41,And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,~)
(Luke,22,42,Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.~)
(Luke,22,43,And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.~)
(Luke,22,44,And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.~)
(Luke,22,45,And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,~)
(Luke,22,46,And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.~)
(Luke,22,47,And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.~)
(Luke,22,48,But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?~)
(Luke,22,49,When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?~)
(Luke,22,50,And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.~)
(Luke,22,51,And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.~)
(Luke,22,52,Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?~)
(Luke,22,53,When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.~)
(Luke,22,54,Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.~)
(Luke,22,55,And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.~)
(Luke,22,56,But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.~)
(Luke,22,57,And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.~)
(Luke,22,58,And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.~)
(Luke,22,59,And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.~)
(Luke,22,60,And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.~)
(Luke,22,61,And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.~)
(Luke,22,62,And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.~)
(Luke,22,63,And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.~)
(Luke,22,64,And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?~)
(Luke,22,65,And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.~)
(Luke,22,66,And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,~)
(Luke,22,67,Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:~)
(Luke,22,68,And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.~)
(Luke,22,69,Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.~)
(Luke,22,70,Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.~)
(Luke,22,71,And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.~)
(Luke,23,1,And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.~)
(Luke,23,2,And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.~)
(Luke,23,3,And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.~)
(Luke,23,4,Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.~)
(Luke,23,5,And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.~)
(Luke,23,6,When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.~)
(Luke,23,7,And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.~)
(Luke,23,8,And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.~)
(Luke,23,9,Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.~)
(Luke,23,10,And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.~)
(Luke,23,11,And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.~)
(Luke,23,12,And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.~)
(Luke,23,13,And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,~)
(Luke,23,14,Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:~)
(Luke,23,15,No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.~)
(Luke,23,16,I will therefore chastise him, and release him.~)
(Luke,23,17,(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)~)
(Luke,23,18,And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:~)
(Luke,23,19,(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)~)
(Luke,23,20,Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.~)
(Luke,23,21,But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.~)
(Luke,23,22,And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.~)
(Luke,23,23,And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.~)
(Luke,23,24,And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.~)
(Luke,23,25,And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.~)
(Luke,23,26,And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.~)
(Luke,23,27,And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.~)
(Luke,23,28,But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.~)
(Luke,23,29,For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.~)
(Luke,23,30,Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.~)
(Luke,23,31,For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?~)
(Luke,23,32,And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.~)
(Luke,23,33,And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.~)
(Luke,23,34,Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.~)
(Luke,23,35,And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.~)
(Luke,23,36,And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,~)
(Luke,23,37,And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.~)
(Luke,23,38,And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.~)
(Luke,23,39,And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.~)
(Luke,23,40,But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?~)
(Luke,23,41,And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.~)
(Luke,23,42,And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.~)
(Luke,23,43,And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.~)
(Luke,23,44,And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.~)
(Luke,23,45,And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.~)
(Luke,23,46,And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.~)
(Luke,23,47,Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.~)
(Luke,23,48,And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.~)
(Luke,23,49,And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.~)
(Luke,23,50,And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:~)
(Luke,23,51,(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.~)
(Luke,23,52,This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.~)
(Luke,23,53,And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.~)
(Luke,23,54,And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.~)
(Luke,23,55,And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.~)
(Luke,23,56,And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.~)
(Luke,24,1,Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.~)
(Luke,24,2,And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.~)
(Luke,24,3,And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.~)
(Luke,24,4,And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:~)
(Luke,24,5,And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?~)
(Luke,24,6,He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,~)
(Luke,24,7,Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.~)
(Luke,24,8,And they remembered his words,~)
(Luke,24,9,And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.~)
(Luke,24,10,It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.~)
(Luke,24,11,And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.~)

(Luke,24,16,But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.~)
(Luke,24,17,And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?~)
(Luke,24,18,And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?~)
(Luke,24,19,And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:~)
(Luke,24,20,And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.~)
(Luke,24,21,But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.~)
(Luke,24,22,Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;~)
(Luke,24,23,And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.~)
(Luke,24,24,And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.~)
(Luke,24,25,Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:~)

(Luke,24,27,And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.~)
(Luke,24,28,And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.~)

(Luke,24,37,But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.~)
(Luke,24,38,And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?~)
(Luke,24,39,Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.~)
(Luke,24,40,And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.~)
(Luke,24,41,And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?~)

(Lamentations,1,15,The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.~)
(Lamentations,1,16,For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.~)

(1 John,2,8,Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.~)
(1 John,2,9,He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.~)
(1 John,2,10,He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.~)
(1 John,2,11,But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.~)
(1 John,2,12,I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.~)
(1 John,2,13,I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.~)
(1 John,2,14,I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.~)
(1 John,2,15,Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.~)
(1 John,2,16,For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.~)
(1 John,2,17,And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.~)
(1 John,2,18,Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.~)
(1 John,2,19,They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.~)
(1 John,2,20,But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.~)
(1 John,2,21,I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.~)
(1 John,2,22,Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.~)
(1 John,2,23,Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.~)
(1 John,2,24,Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.~)
(1 John,2,25,And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.~)
(1 John,2,26,These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.~)
(1 John,2,27,But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.~)
(1 John,2,28,And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.~)
(1 John,2,29,If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.~)
(1 John,3,1,Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.~)
(1 John,3,2,Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.~)
(1 John,3,3,And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.~)
(1 John,3,4,Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.~)
(1 John,3,5,And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.~)
(1 John,3,6,Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.~)
(1 John,3,7,Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.~)
(1 John,3,8,He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.~)
(1 John,3,9,Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.~)
(1 John,3,10,In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.~)
(1 John,3,11,For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.~)
(1 John,3,12,Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.~)
(1 John,3,13,Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.~)
(1 John,3,14,We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.~)
(1 John,3,15,Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.~)
(1 John,3,16,Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.~)
(1 John,3,17,But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?~)
(1 John,3,18,My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.~)
(1 John,3,19,And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.~)
(1 John,3,20,For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.~)
(1 John,3,21,Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.~)
(1 John,3,22,And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.~)
(1 John,3,23,And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.~)
(1 John,3,24,And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.~)
(1 John,4,1,Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.~)
(1 John,4,2,Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:~)
(1 John,4,3,And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.~)
(1 John,4,4,Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.~)
(1 John,4,5,They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.~)
(1 John,4,6,We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.~)
(1 John,4,7,Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.~)
(1 John,4,8,He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.~)
(1 John,4,9,In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.~)
(1 John,4,10,Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.~)
(1 John,4,11,Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.~)
(1 John,4,12,No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.~)
(1 John,4,13,Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.~)
(1 John,4,14,And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.~)
(1 John,4,15,Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.~)
(1 John,4,16,And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.~)
(1 John,4,17,Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.~)
(1 John,4,18,There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.~)
(1 John,4,19,We love him, because he first loved us.~)
(1 John,4,20,If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?~)
(1 John,4,21,And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.~)
(1 John,5,1,Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.~)
(1 John,5,2,By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.~)
(1 John,5,3,For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.~)
(1 John,5,4,For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.~)
(1 John,5,5,Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?~)
(1 John,5,6,This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.~)
(1 John,5,7,For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.~)
(1 John,5,8,And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.~)
(1 John,5,9,If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.~)
(1 John,5,10,He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.~)
(1 John,5,11,And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.~)
(1 John,5,12,He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.~)
(1 John,5,13,These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.~)
(1 John,5,14,And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:~)
(1 John,5,15,And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.~)
(1 John,5,16,If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.~)
(1 John,5,17,All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.~)
(1 John,5,18,We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.~)
(1 John,5,19,And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.~)
(1 John,5,20,And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.~)
(1 John,5,21,Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.~)
(Joel,1,1,The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.~)
(Joel,1,2,Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?~)

(Joel,1,8,Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.~)
(Joel,1,9,The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.~)
(Joel,1,10,The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.~)
(Joel,1,11,Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.~)
(Joel,1,12,The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.~)
(Joel,1,13,Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.~)
(Joel,1,14,Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,~)
(Joel,1,15,Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.~)
(Joel,1,16,Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?~)
(Joel,1,17,The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.~)
(Joel,1,18,How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.~)
(Joel,1,19,O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.~)
(Joel,1,20,The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.~)
(Joel,2,1,Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;~)
(Joel,2,2,A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.~)
(Joel,2,3,A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.~)
(Joel,2,4,The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.~)
(Joel,2,5,Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.~)
(Joel,2,6,Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall gather blackness.~)
(Joel,2,7,They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks:~)
(Joel,2,8,Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.~)
(Joel,2,9,They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.~)
(Joel,2,10,The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining:~)
(Joel,2,11,And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?~)

(Joel,2,14,Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?~)
(Joel,2,15,Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:~)
(Joel,2,16,Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.~)
(Joel,2,17,Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?~)
(Joel,2,18,Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.~)
(Joel,2,19,Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:~)
(Joel,2,20,But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.~)
(Joel,2,21,Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.~)

(Joel,3,16,The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.~)
(Joel,3,17,So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.~)
(Joel,3,18,And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.~)
(Joel,3,19,Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.~)
(Joel,3,20,But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.~)
(Joel,3,21,For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.~)

(Acts,15,23,And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.~)
(Acts,15,24,Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:~)
(Acts,15,25,It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,~)
(Acts,15,26,Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Acts,15,27,We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.~)
(Acts,15,28,For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;~)
(Acts,15,29,That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.~)
(Acts,15,30,So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:~)
(Acts,15,31,Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.~)
(Acts,15,32,And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.~)
(Acts,15,33,And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.~)
(Acts,15,34,Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.~)
(Acts,15,35,Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.~)

(Acts,15,37,And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.~)
(Acts,15,38,But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.~)
(Acts,15,39,And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;~)
(Acts,15,40,And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.~)
(Acts,15,41,And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.~)
(Acts,16,1,Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:~)
(Acts,16,2,Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.~)
(Acts,16,3,Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.~)
(Acts,16,4,And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.~)

(Acts,16,11,Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;~)
(Acts,16,12,And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.~)

(Acts,16,16,And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:~)
(Acts,16,17,The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.~)
(Acts,16,18,And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.~)
(Acts,16,19,And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,~)
(Acts,16,20,And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,~)
(Acts,16,21,And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.~)
(Acts,16,22,And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.~)
(Acts,16,23,And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:~)
(Acts,16,24,Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.~)
(Acts,16,25,And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.~)

(Acts,16,30,And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?~)
(Acts,16,31,And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.~)
(Acts,16,32,And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.~)
(Acts,16,33,And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.~)
(Acts,16,34,And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.~)
(Acts,16,35,And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.~)
(Acts,16,36,And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.~)
(Acts,16,37,But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.~)
(Acts,16,38,And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.~)

(Acts,17,1,Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:~)
(Acts,17,2,And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,~)
(Acts,17,3,Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.~)
(Acts,17,4,And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.~)
(Acts,17,5,But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.~)
(Acts,17,6,And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;~)
(Acts,17,7,Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.~)
(Acts,17,8,And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.~)
(Acts,17,9,And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.~)
(Acts,17,10,And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.~)
(Acts,17,11,These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.~)
(Acts,17,12,Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.~)
(Acts,17,13,But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.~)
(Acts,17,14,And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.~)
(Acts,17,15,And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.~)
(Acts,17,16,Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.~)
(Acts,17,17,Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.~)
(Acts,17,18,Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.~)
(Acts,17,19,And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?~)
(Acts,17,20,For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.~)
(Acts,17,21,(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)~)
(Acts,17,22,Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.~)
(Acts,17,23,For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.~)
(Acts,17,24,God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;~)
(Acts,17,25,Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;~)
(Acts,17,26,And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;~)
(Acts,17,27,That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:~)
(Acts,17,28,For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.~)
(Acts,17,29,Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.~)
(Acts,17,30,And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:~)
(Acts,17,31,Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.~)
(Acts,17,32,And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.~)
(Acts,17,33,So Paul departed from among them.~)
(Acts,17,34,Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.~)
(Acts,18,1,After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;~)
(Acts,18,2,And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.~)
(Acts,18,3,And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.~)
(Acts,18,4,And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.~)
(Acts,18,5,And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.~)
(Acts,18,6,And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.~)
(Acts,18,7,And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.~)
(Acts,18,8,And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.~)
(Acts,18,9,Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:~)
(Acts,18,10,For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.~)
(Acts,18,11,And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.~)
(Acts,18,12,And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,~)
(Acts,18,13,Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.~)
(Acts,18,14,And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:~)
(Acts,18,15,But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.~)
(Acts,18,16,And he drave them from the judgment seat.~)
(Acts,18,17,Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.~)
(Acts,18,18,And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.~)
(Acts,18,19,And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.~)
(Acts,18,20,When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;~)
(Acts,18,21,But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.~)
(Acts,18,22,And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.~)
(Acts,18,23,And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.~)
(Acts,18,24,And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.~)

(Acts,18,26,And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.~)
(Acts,18,27,And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:~)
(Acts,18,28,For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.~)
(Acts,19,1,And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,~)
(Acts,19,2,He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?  And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.~)
(Acts,19,3,And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.~)
(Acts,19,4,Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.~)
(Acts,19,5,When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.~)
(Acts,19,6,And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.~)
(Acts,19,7,And all the men were about twelve.~)
(Acts,19,8,And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.~)
(Acts,19,9,But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.~)
(Acts,19,10,And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.~)
(Acts,19,11,And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:~)
(Acts,19,12,So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.~)
(Acts,19,13,Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.~)
(Acts,19,14,And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.~)
(Acts,19,15,And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?~)
(Acts,19,16,And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.~)
(Acts,19,17,And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.~)
(Acts,19,18,And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.~)
(Acts,19,19,Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.~)
(Acts,19,20,So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.~)
(Acts,19,21,After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.~)
(Acts,19,22,So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.~)
(Acts,19,23,And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.~)
(Acts,19,24,For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;~)
(Acts,19,25,Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.~)
(Acts,19,26,Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:~)
(Acts,19,27,So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.~)
(Acts,19,28,And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.~)
(Acts,19,29,And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.~)
(Acts,19,30,And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.~)
(Acts,19,31,And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.~)
(Acts,19,32,Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.~)
(Acts,19,33,And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.~)
(Acts,19,34,But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.~)
(Acts,19,35,And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?~)
(Acts,19,36,Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.~)
(Acts,19,37,For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.~)
(Acts,19,38,Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.~)
(Acts,19,39,But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.~)
(Acts,19,40,For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.~)
(Acts,19,41,And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.~)
(Acts,20,1,And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.~)
(Acts,20,2,And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,~)
(Acts,20,3,And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.~)
(Acts,20,4,And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.~)
(Acts,20,5,These going before tarried for us at Troas.~)

(Acts,20,7,And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.~)
(Acts,20,8,And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.~)
(Acts,20,9,And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.~)
(Acts,20,10,And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.~)
(Acts,20,11,When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.~)
(Acts,20,12,And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.~)
(Acts,20,13,And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.~)
(Acts,20,14,And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.~)
(Acts,20,15,And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.~)
(Acts,20,16,For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.~)
(Acts,20,17,And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.~)
(Acts,20,18,And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,~)
(Acts,20,19,Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:~)
(Acts,20,20,And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,~)
(Acts,20,21,Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.~)
(Acts,20,22,And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:~)
(Acts,20,23,Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.~)
(Acts,20,24,But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.~)
(Acts,20,25,And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.~)
(Acts,20,26,Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.~)
(Acts,20,27,For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.~)
(Acts,20,28,Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.~)
(Acts,20,29,For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.~)
(Acts,20,30,Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.~)
(Acts,20,31,Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.~)
(Acts,20,32,And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.~)
(Acts,20,33,I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.~)
(Acts,20,34,Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.~)
(Acts,20,35,I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.~)
(Acts,20,36,And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.~)

(Acts,24,3,We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.~)
(Acts,24,4,Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.~)

(Acts,24,11,Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.~)

(Acts,24,20,Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,~)
(Acts,24,21,Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.~)

(Acts,25,10,Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.~)
(Acts,25,11,For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.~)

(Acts,26,31,And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.~)
(Acts,26,32,Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.~)
(Acts,27,1,And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band.~)
(Acts,27,2,And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.~)
(Acts,27,3,And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.~)
(Acts,27,4,And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.~)
(Acts,27,5,And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.~)
(Acts,27,6,And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.~)
(Acts,27,7,And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;~)
(Acts,27,8,And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.~)
(Acts,27,9,Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,~)
(Acts,27,10,And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.~)
(Acts,27,11,Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.~)
(Acts,27,12,And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.~)
(Acts,27,13,And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.~)
(Acts,27,14,But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.~)
(Acts,27,15,And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.~)
(Acts,27,16,And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:~)
(Acts,27,17,Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.~)
(Acts,27,18,And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;~)
(Acts,27,19,And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.~)
(Acts,27,20,And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.~)
(Acts,27,21,But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.~)
(Acts,27,22,And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.~)
(Acts,27,23,For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,~)
(Acts,27,24,Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.~)
(Acts,27,25,Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.~)
(Acts,27,26,Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.~)
(Acts,27,27,But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;~)
(Acts,27,28,And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.~)
(Acts,27,29,Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.~)
(Acts,27,30,And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,~)
(Acts,27,31,Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.~)
(Acts,27,32,Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.~)
(Acts,27,33,And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.~)
(Acts,27,34,Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.~)
(Acts,27,35,And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.~)
(Acts,27,36,Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.~)
(Acts,27,37,And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.~)
(Acts,27,38,And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.~)
(Acts,27,39,And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.~)
(Acts,27,40,And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.~)
(Acts,27,41,And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.~)
(Acts,27,42,And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.~)
(Acts,27,43,But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:~)
(Acts,27,44,And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.~)
(Acts,28,1,And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.~)
(Acts,28,2,And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.~)
(Acts,28,3,And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.~)
(Acts,28,4,And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.~)
(Acts,28,5,And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.~)
(Acts,28,6,Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.~)
(Acts,28,7,In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.~)
(Acts,28,8,And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.~)
(Acts,28,9,So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:~)
(Acts,28,10,Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.~)
(Acts,28,11,And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.~)
(Acts,28,12,And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.~)
(Acts,28,13,And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:~)
(Acts,28,14,Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.~)
(Acts,28,15,And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.~)
(Acts,28,16,And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.~)
(Acts,28,17,And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.~)
(Acts,28,18,Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.~)
(Acts,28,19,But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.~)
(Acts,28,20,For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.~)
(Acts,28,21,And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.~)
(Acts,28,22,But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.~)
(Acts,28,23,And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.~)
(Acts,28,24,And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.~)
(Acts,28,25,And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,~)
(Acts,28,26,Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:~)
(Acts,28,27,For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.~)
(Acts,28,28,Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.~)
(Acts,28,29,And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.~)
(Acts,28,30,And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,~)
(Acts,28,31,Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.~)
(Zechariah,1,1,In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,~)
(Zechariah,1,2,The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.~)
(Zechariah,1,3,Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Zechariah,1,4,Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,1,5,Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?~)
(Zechariah,1,6,But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.~)
(Zechariah,1,7,Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,~)
(Zechariah,1,8,I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.~)
(Zechariah,1,9,Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.~)
(Zechariah,1,10,And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.~)
(Zechariah,1,11,And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.~)
(Zechariah,1,12,Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?~)
(Zechariah,1,13,And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.~)
(Zechariah,1,14,So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.~)
(Zechariah,1,15,And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.~)
(Zechariah,1,16,Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.~)
(Zechariah,1,17,Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.~)
(Zechariah,1,18,Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.~)
(Zechariah,1,19,And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.~)
(Zechariah,1,20,And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.~)
(Zechariah,1,21,Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.~)
(Zechariah,2,1,I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.~)
(Zechariah,2,2,Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.~)
(Zechariah,2,3,And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,~)
(Zechariah,2,4,And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:~)
(Zechariah,2,5,For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.~)
(Zechariah,2,6,Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,2,7,Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.~)
(Zechariah,2,8,For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.~)
(Zechariah,2,9,For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.~)
(Zechariah,2,10,Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,2,11,And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.~)
(Zechariah,2,12,And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.~)
(Zechariah,2,13,Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.~)
(Zechariah,3,1,And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.~)
(Zechariah,3,2,And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?~)
(Zechariah,3,3,Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.~)
(Zechariah,3,4,And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.~)
(Zechariah,3,5,And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.~)
(Zechariah,3,6,And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,~)
(Zechariah,3,7,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.~)
(Zechariah,3,8,Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.~)
(Zechariah,3,9,For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.~)
(Zechariah,3,10,In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.~)
(Zechariah,4,1,And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.~)
(Zechariah,4,2,And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:~)
(Zechariah,4,3,And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.~)
(Zechariah,4,4,So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?~)
(Zechariah,4,5,Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.~)
(Zechariah,4,6,Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Zechariah,4,7,Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.~)
(Zechariah,4,8,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Zechariah,4,9,The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.~)
(Zechariah,4,10,For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.~)
(Zechariah,4,11,Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof?~)
(Zechariah,4,12,And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?~)
(Zechariah,4,13,And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.~)
(Zechariah,4,14,Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.~)
(Zechariah,5,1,Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.~)
(Zechariah,5,2,And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.~)
(Zechariah,5,3,Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.~)
(Zechariah,5,4,I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.~)
(Zechariah,5,5,Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.~)
(Zechariah,5,6,And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.~)
(Zechariah,5,7,And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.~)
(Zechariah,5,8,And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.~)
(Zechariah,5,9,Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.~)
(Zechariah,5,10,Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?~)
(Zechariah,5,11,And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.~)
(Zechariah,6,1,And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.~)
(Zechariah,6,2,In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;~)
(Zechariah,6,3,And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.~)
(Zechariah,6,4,Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?~)
(Zechariah,6,5,And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.~)
(Zechariah,6,6,The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.~)
(Zechariah,6,7,And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.~)
(Zechariah,6,8,Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.~)
(Zechariah,6,9,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Zechariah,6,10,Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;~)
(Zechariah,6,11,Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;~)
(Zechariah,6,12,And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:~)
(Zechariah,6,13,Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.~)
(Zechariah,6,14,And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,6,15,And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.~)
(Zechariah,7,1,And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;~)
(Zechariah,7,2,When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,~)
(Zechariah,7,3,And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?~)
(Zechariah,7,4,Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,~)
(Zechariah,7,5,Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?~)
(Zechariah,7,6,And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?~)
(Zechariah,7,7,Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?~)
(Zechariah,7,8,And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,~)
(Zechariah,7,9,Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:~)
(Zechariah,7,10,And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.~)
(Zechariah,7,11,But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.~)
(Zechariah,7,12,Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.~)
(Zechariah,7,13,Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:~)
(Zechariah,7,14,But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.~)
(Zechariah,8,1,Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,~)
(Zechariah,8,2,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.~)
(Zechariah,8,3,Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.~)
(Zechariah,8,4,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.~)
(Zechariah,8,5,And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.~)
(Zechariah,8,6,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Zechariah,8,7,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;~)
(Zechariah,8,8,And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.~)
(Zechariah,8,9,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.~)
(Zechariah,8,10,For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.~)
(Zechariah,8,11,But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.~)
(Zechariah,8,12,For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.~)
(Zechariah,8,13,And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands be strong.~)
(Zechariah,8,14,For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not:~)
(Zechariah,8,15,So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.~)
(Zechariah,8,16,These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:~)
(Zechariah,8,17,And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,8,18,And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,~)
(Zechariah,8,19,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace.~)
(Zechariah,8,20,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:~)
(Zechariah,8,21,And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I will go also.~)
(Zechariah,8,22,Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,8,23,Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God is with you.~)
(Zechariah,9,1,The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,9,2,And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.~)
(Zechariah,9,3,And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.~)
(Zechariah,9,4,Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.~)
(Zechariah,9,5,Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.~)
(Zechariah,9,6,And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.~)
(Zechariah,9,7,And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.~)
(Zechariah,9,8,And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.~)
(Zechariah,9,9,Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.~)
(Zechariah,9,10,And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.~)
(Zechariah,9,11,As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.~)
(Zechariah,9,12,Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;~)
(Zechariah,9,13,When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.~)
(Zechariah,9,14,And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.~)
(Zechariah,9,15,The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.~)
(Zechariah,9,16,And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.~)
(Zechariah,9,17,For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.~)
(Zechariah,10,1,Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.~)
(Zechariah,10,2,For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.~)
(Zechariah,10,3,Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.~)
(Zechariah,10,4,Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.~)
(Zechariah,10,5,And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.~)
(Zechariah,10,6,And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.~)
(Zechariah,10,7,And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,10,8,I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.~)
(Zechariah,10,9,And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.~)
(Zechariah,10,10,I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.~)
(Zechariah,10,11,And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.~)
(Zechariah,10,12,And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,11,1,Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.~)
(Zechariah,11,2,Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.~)
(Zechariah,11,3,There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.~)
(Zechariah,11,4,Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;~)
(Zechariah,11,5,Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.~)
(Zechariah,11,6,For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.~)
(Zechariah,11,7,And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.~)
(Zechariah,11,8,Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.~)
(Zechariah,11,9,Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.~)
(Zechariah,11,10,And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.~)
(Zechariah,11,11,And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,11,12,And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.~)
(Zechariah,11,13,And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.~)
(Zechariah,11,14,Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.~)
(Zechariah,11,15,And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.~)
(Zechariah,11,16,For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.~)
(Zechariah,11,17,Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.~)
(Zechariah,12,1,The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.~)
(Zechariah,12,2,Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.~)
(Zechariah,12,3,And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.~)
(Zechariah,12,4,In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness.~)
(Zechariah,12,5,And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.~)
(Zechariah,12,6,In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.~)
(Zechariah,12,7,The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.~)
(Zechariah,12,8,In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.~)
(Zechariah,12,9,And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.~)
(Zechariah,12,10,And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.~)
(Zechariah,12,11,In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.~)
(Zechariah,12,12,And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;~)
(Zechariah,12,13,The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;~)
(Zechariah,12,14,All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.~)
(Zechariah,13,1,In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.~)
(Zechariah,13,2,And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.~)
(Zechariah,13,3,And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.~)
(Zechariah,13,4,And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:~)
(Zechariah,13,5,But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.~)
(Zechariah,13,6,And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.~)
(Zechariah,13,7,Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.~)
(Zechariah,13,8,And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.~)
(Zechariah,13,9,And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.~)
(Zechariah,14,1,Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee.~)
(Zechariah,14,2,For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.~)
(Zechariah,14,3,Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.~)
(Zechariah,14,4,And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.~)
(Zechariah,14,5,And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with thee.~)
(Zechariah,14,6,And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:~)
(Zechariah,14,7,But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.~)
(Zechariah,14,8,And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.~)
(Zechariah,14,9,And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.~)
(Zechariah,14,10,All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.~)
(Zechariah,14,11,And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.~)
(Zechariah,14,12,And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.~)
(Zechariah,14,13,And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.~)
(Zechariah,14,14,And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.~)
(Zechariah,14,15,And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.~)
(Zechariah,14,16,And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.~)
(Zechariah,14,17,And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.~)
(Zechariah,14,18,And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.~)
(Zechariah,14,19,This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.~)
(Zechariah,14,20,In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall be like the bowls before the altar.~)
(Zechariah,14,21,Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.~)
(Numbers,1,1,And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,~)
(Numbers,1,2,Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;~)
(Numbers,1,3,From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.~)
(Numbers,1,4,And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers.~)

(Numbers,17,3,And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.~)
(Numbers,17,4,And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.~)

(Numbers,18,9,This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.~)
(Numbers,18,10,In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee.~)
(Numbers,18,11,And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.~)

(Numbers,18,14,Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.~)
(Numbers,18,15,Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.~)
(Numbers,18,16,And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.~)
(Numbers,18,17,But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.~)
(Numbers,18,18,And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine.~)
(Numbers,18,19,All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.~)
(Numbers,18,20,And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.~)

(Numbers,18,22,Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.~)
(Numbers,18,23,But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.~)
(Numbers,18,24,But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.~)
(Numbers,18,25,And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~)
(Numbers,18,26,Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.~)
(Numbers,18,27,And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.~)

(Numbers,18,29,Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.~)
(Numbers,18,30,Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.~)

(Numbers,20,17,Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.~)
(Numbers,20,18,And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.~)

(Numbers,21,27,Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:~)

(Numbers,22,5,He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:~)
(Numbers,22,6,Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.~)
(Numbers,22,7,And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.~)
(Numbers,22,8,And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.~)
(Numbers,22,9,And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?~)
(Numbers,22,10,And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,~)
(Numbers,22,11,Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.~)
(Numbers,22,12,And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.~)
(Numbers,22,13,And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.~)
(Numbers,22,14,And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.~)
(Numbers,22,15,And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.~)
(Numbers,22,16,And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:~)
(Numbers,22,17,For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.~)
(Numbers,22,18,And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.~)
(Numbers,22,19,Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.~)
(Numbers,22,20,And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.~)
(Numbers,22,21,And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.~)
(Numbers,22,22,And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.~)
(Numbers,22,23,And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.~)
(Numbers,22,24,But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.~)
(Numbers,22,25,And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.~)
(Numbers,22,26,And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.~)
(Numbers,22,27,And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.~)
(Numbers,22,28,And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?~)
(Numbers,22,29,And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.~)
(Numbers,22,30,And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.~)
(Numbers,22,31,Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.~)
(Numbers,22,32,And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:~)
(Numbers,22,33,And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.~)
(Numbers,22,34,And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.~)
(Numbers,22,35,And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.~)
(Numbers,22,36,And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.~)
(Numbers,22,37,And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?~)
(Numbers,22,38,And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.~)
(Numbers,22,39,And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.~)
(Numbers,22,40,And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.~)
(Numbers,22,41,And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.~)

(Numbers,33,56,Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.~)
(Numbers,34,1,And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~)
(Numbers,34,2,Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)~)
(Numbers,34,3,Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:~)
(Numbers,34,4,And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:~)
(Numbers,34,5,And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.~)
(Numbers,34,6,And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border.~)
(Numbers,34,7,And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor:~)
(Numbers,34,8,From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:~)
(Numbers,34,9,And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.~)
(Numbers,34,10,And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:~)
(Numbers,34,11,And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:~)
(Numbers,34,12,And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.~)
(Numbers,34,13,And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:~)
(Numbers,34,14,For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:~)
(Numbers,34,15,The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.~)

(Numbers,35,3,And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.~)
(Numbers,35,4,And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.~)
(Numbers,35,5,And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.~)
(Numbers,35,6,And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.~)
(Numbers,35,7,So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.~)
(Numbers,35,8,And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.~)
(Numbers,35,9,And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~)
(Numbers,35,10,Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;~)
(Numbers,35,11,Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.~)
(Numbers,35,12,And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.~)
(Numbers,35,13,And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge.~)
(Numbers,35,14,Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.~)
(Numbers,35,15,These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.~)
(Numbers,35,16,And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.~)
(Numbers,35,17,And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.~)
(Numbers,35,18,Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.~)
(Numbers,35,19,The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.~)
(Numbers,35,20,But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;~)
(Numbers,35,21,Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.~)
(Numbers,35,22,But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,~)
(Numbers,35,23,Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:~)

(Numbers,35,25,And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.~)
(Numbers,35,26,But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;~)
(Numbers,35,27,And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:~)
(Numbers,35,28,Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.~)
(Numbers,35,29,So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.~)

(Numbers,35,32,And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.~)
(Numbers,35,33,So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.~)
(Numbers,35,34,Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.~)

(Numbers,36,2,And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.~)
(Numbers,36,3,And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.~)
(Numbers,36,4,And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.~)
(Numbers,36,5,And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.~)
(Numbers,36,6,This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.~)
(Numbers,36,7,So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.~)
(Numbers,36,8,And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.~)
(Numbers,36,9,Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.~)
(Numbers,36,10,Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:~)
(Numbers,36,11,For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:~)
(Numbers,36,12,And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.~)
(Numbers,36,13,These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.~)
(Ezekiel,1,1,Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.~)
(Ezekiel,1,2,In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,~)
(Ezekiel,1,3,The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.~)
(Ezekiel,1,4,And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.~)
(Ezekiel,1,5,Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.~)
(Ezekiel,1,6,And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.~)
(Ezekiel,1,7,And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.~)
(Ezekiel,1,8,And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.~)
(Ezekiel,1,9,Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.~)
(Ezekiel,1,10,As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.~)
(Ezekiel,1,11,Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.~)
(Ezekiel,1,12,And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.~)
(Ezekiel,1,13,As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.~)
(Ezekiel,1,14,And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.~)
(Ezekiel,1,15,Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.~)
(Ezekiel,1,16,The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.~)
(Ezekiel,1,17,When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.~)
(Ezekiel,1,18,As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.~)
(Ezekiel,1,19,And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.~)
(Ezekiel,1,20,Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.~)
(Ezekiel,1,21,When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.~)
(Ezekiel,1,22,And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.~)
(Ezekiel,1,23,And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.~)
(Ezekiel,1,24,And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.~)
(Ezekiel,1,25,And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.~)
(Ezekiel,1,26,And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.~)
(Ezekiel,1,27,And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.~)
(Ezekiel,1,28,As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.~)
(Ezekiel,2,1,And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.~)
(Ezekiel,2,2,And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.~)
(Ezekiel,2,3,And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.~)
(Ezekiel,2,4,For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,2,5,And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.~)
(Ezekiel,2,6,And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.~)
(Ezekiel,2,7,And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.~)
(Ezekiel,2,8,But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.~)
(Ezekiel,2,9,And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;~)
(Ezekiel,2,10,And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.~)
(Ezekiel,3,1,Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,3,2,So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.~)
(Ezekiel,3,3,And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.~)
(Ezekiel,3,4,And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.~)
(Ezekiel,3,5,For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;~)
(Ezekiel,3,6,Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.~)
(Ezekiel,3,7,But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.~)
(Ezekiel,3,8,Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.~)
(Ezekiel,3,9,As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.~)
(Ezekiel,3,10,Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.~)
(Ezekiel,3,11,And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.~)
(Ezekiel,3,12,Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.~)
(Ezekiel,3,13,I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.~)
(Ezekiel,3,14,So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.~)
(Ezekiel,3,15,Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.~)
(Ezekiel,3,16,And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,3,17,Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.~)
(Ezekiel,3,18,When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.~)
(Ezekiel,3,19,Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.~)
(Ezekiel,3,20,Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.~)
(Ezekiel,3,21,Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.~)
(Ezekiel,3,22,And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.~)
(Ezekiel,3,23,Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.~)
(Ezekiel,3,24,Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.~)
(Ezekiel,3,25,But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:~)
(Ezekiel,3,26,And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.~)
(Ezekiel,3,27,But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.~)
(Ezekiel,4,1,Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:~)
(Ezekiel,4,2,And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.~)
(Ezekiel,4,3,Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,4,4,Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,4,5,For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,4,6,And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.~)
(Ezekiel,4,7,Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.~)
(Ezekiel,4,8,And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.~)
(Ezekiel,4,9,Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,4,10,And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.~)
(Ezekiel,4,11,Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.~)
(Ezekiel,4,12,And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.~)
(Ezekiel,4,13,And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.~)
(Ezekiel,4,14,Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.~)
(Ezekiel,4,15,Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.~)
(Ezekiel,4,16,Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:~)
(Ezekiel,4,17,That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,5,1,And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.~)
(Ezekiel,5,2,Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.~)
(Ezekiel,5,3,Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.~)
(Ezekiel,5,4,Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,5,5,Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her.~)
(Ezekiel,5,6,And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.~)
(Ezekiel,5,7,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;~)
(Ezekiel,5,8,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.~)
(Ezekiel,5,9,And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,5,10,Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.~)
(Ezekiel,5,11,Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.~)
(Ezekiel,5,12,A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.~)
(Ezekiel,5,13,Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.~)
(Ezekiel,5,14,Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.~)
(Ezekiel,5,15,So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.~)
(Ezekiel,5,16,When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:~)
(Ezekiel,5,17,So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee: and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.~)
(Ezekiel,6,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,6,2,Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,~)
(Ezekiel,6,3,And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.~)
(Ezekiel,6,4,And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.~)
(Ezekiel,6,5,And I will lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.~)
(Ezekiel,6,6,In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.~)
(Ezekiel,6,7,And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,6,8,Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.~)
(Ezekiel,6,9,And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,6,10,And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.~)
(Ezekiel,6,11,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.~)
(Ezekiel,6,12,He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury upon them.~)
(Ezekiel,6,13,Then shall ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols.~)
(Ezekiel,6,14,So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,7,1,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,7,2,Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.~)
(Ezekiel,7,3,Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,7,4,And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,7,5,Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.~)
(Ezekiel,7,6,An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.~)
(Ezekiel,7,7,The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.~)
(Ezekiel,7,8,Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,7,9,And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth.~)
(Ezekiel,7,10,Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.~)
(Ezekiel,7,11,Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither shall there be wailing for them.~)
(Ezekiel,7,12,The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,7,13,For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.~)
(Ezekiel,7,14,They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,7,15,The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.~)
(Ezekiel,7,16,But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,7,17,All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.~)
(Ezekiel,7,18,They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.~)
(Ezekiel,7,19,They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,7,20,As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.~)
(Ezekiel,7,21,And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.~)
(Ezekiel,7,22,My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.~)
(Ezekiel,7,23,Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.~)
(Ezekiel,7,24,Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.~)
(Ezekiel,7,25,Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.~)
(Ezekiel,7,26,Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.~)
(Ezekiel,7,27,The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,8,1,And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.~)
(Ezekiel,8,2,Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.~)
(Ezekiel,8,3,And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.~)
(Ezekiel,8,4,And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.~)
(Ezekiel,8,5,Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.~)
(Ezekiel,8,6,He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,8,7,And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.~)
(Ezekiel,8,8,Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.~)
(Ezekiel,8,9,And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.~)
(Ezekiel,8,10,So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wall round about.~)
(Ezekiel,8,11,And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.~)
(Ezekiel,8,12,Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.~)
(Ezekiel,8,13,He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.~)
(Ezekiel,8,14,Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.~)
(Ezekiel,8,15,Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.~)
(Ezekiel,8,16,And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.~)
(Ezekiel,8,17,Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.~)
(Ezekiel,8,18,Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.~)
(Ezekiel,9,1,He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.~)
(Ezekiel,9,2,And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.~)
(Ezekiel,9,3,And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side;~)
(Ezekiel,9,4,And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,9,5,And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity:~)
(Ezekiel,9,6,Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.~)
(Ezekiel,9,7,And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.~)
(Ezekiel,9,8,And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?~)
(Ezekiel,9,9,Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.~)
(Ezekiel,9,10,And as for me also, mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way upon their head.~)
(Ezekiel,9,11,And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.~)
(Ezekiel,10,1,Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.~)
(Ezekiel,10,2,And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.~)
(Ezekiel,10,3,Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.~)
(Ezekiel,10,4,Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD's glory.~)
(Ezekiel,10,5,And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.~)
(Ezekiel,10,6,And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.~)
(Ezekiel,10,7,And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.~)
(Ezekiel,10,8,And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.~)
(Ezekiel,10,9,And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.~)
(Ezekiel,10,10,And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.~)
(Ezekiel,10,11,When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.~)
(Ezekiel,10,12,And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.~)
(Ezekiel,10,13,As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.~)
(Ezekiel,10,14,And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.~)
(Ezekiel,10,15,And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar.~)
(Ezekiel,10,16,And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them.~)
(Ezekiel,10,17,When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.~)
(Ezekiel,10,18,Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims.~)
(Ezekiel,10,19,And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.~)
(Ezekiel,10,20,This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.~)
(Ezekiel,10,21,Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.~)
(Ezekiel,10,22,And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.~)
(Ezekiel,11,1,Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD's house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.~)
(Ezekiel,11,2,Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city:~)
(Ezekiel,11,3,Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.~)
(Ezekiel,11,4,Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.~)
(Ezekiel,11,5,And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.~)
(Ezekiel,11,6,Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.~)
(Ezekiel,11,7,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.~)
(Ezekiel,11,8,Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,11,9,And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.~)
(Ezekiel,11,10,Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,11,11,This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I will judge you in the border of Israel:~)
(Ezekiel,11,12,And ye shall know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you.~)
(Ezekiel,11,13,And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?~)
(Ezekiel,11,14,Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,11,15,Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.~)
(Ezekiel,11,16,Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.~)
(Ezekiel,11,17,Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,11,18,And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.~)
(Ezekiel,11,19,And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh:~)
(Ezekiel,11,20,That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.~)
(Ezekiel,11,21,But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,11,22,Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.~)
(Ezekiel,11,23,And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.~)
(Ezekiel,11,24,Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.~)
(Ezekiel,11,25,Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.~)
(Ezekiel,12,1,The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,12,2,Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.~)
(Ezekiel,12,3,Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.~)
(Ezekiel,12,4,Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.~)
(Ezekiel,12,5,Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.~)
(Ezekiel,12,6,In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,12,7,And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.~)
(Ezekiel,12,8,And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,12,9,Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?~)
(Ezekiel,12,10,Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.~)
(Ezekiel,12,11,Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.~)
(Ezekiel,12,12,And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.~)
(Ezekiel,12,13,My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.~)
(Ezekiel,12,14,And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.~)
(Ezekiel,12,15,And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.~)
(Ezekiel,12,16,But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,12,17,Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,12,18,Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;~)
(Ezekiel,12,19,And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.~)
(Ezekiel,12,20,And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,12,21,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,12,22,Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?~)
(Ezekiel,12,23,Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.~)
(Ezekiel,12,24,For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,12,25,For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,12,26,Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying.~)
(Ezekiel,12,27,Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.~)
(Ezekiel,12,28,Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,13,2,Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;~)
(Ezekiel,13,3,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!~)
(Ezekiel,13,4,O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.~)
(Ezekiel,13,5,Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,6,They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.~)
(Ezekiel,13,7,Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?~)
(Ezekiel,13,8,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,9,And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,10,Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:~)
(Ezekiel,13,11,Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.~)
(Ezekiel,13,12,Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?~)
(Ezekiel,13,13,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.~)
(Ezekiel,13,14,So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,15,Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;~)
(Ezekiel,13,16,To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,17,Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,~)
(Ezekiel,13,18,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?~)
(Ezekiel,13,19,And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?~)
(Ezekiel,13,20,Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.~)
(Ezekiel,13,21,Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,13,22,Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:~)
(Ezekiel,13,23,Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,14,1,Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.~)
(Ezekiel,14,2,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,14,3,Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?~)
(Ezekiel,14,4,Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols;~)
(Ezekiel,14,5,That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.~)
(Ezekiel,14,6,Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,14,7,For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:~)
(Ezekiel,14,8,And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,14,9,And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,14,10,And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him;~)
(Ezekiel,14,11,That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,14,12,The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,14,13,Son of man, when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it:~)
(Ezekiel,14,14,Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,14,15,If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:~)
(Ezekiel,14,16,Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.~)
(Ezekiel,14,17,Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it:~)
(Ezekiel,14,18,Though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.~)
(Ezekiel,14,19,Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:~)
(Ezekiel,14,20,Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.~)
(Ezekiel,14,21,For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?~)
(Ezekiel,14,22,Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.~)
(Ezekiel,14,23,And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,15,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,15,2,Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?~)
(Ezekiel,15,3,Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?~)
(Ezekiel,15,4,Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?~)
(Ezekiel,15,5,Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?~)
(Ezekiel,15,6,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.~)
(Ezekiel,15,7,And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.~)
(Ezekiel,15,8,And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,16,1,Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,16,2,Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,~)
(Ezekiel,16,3,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite.~)
(Ezekiel,16,4,And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.~)
(Ezekiel,16,5,None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.~)
(Ezekiel,16,6,And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.~)
(Ezekiel,16,7,I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare.~)
(Ezekiel,16,8,Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.~)
(Ezekiel,16,9,Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.~)
(Ezekiel,16,10,I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.~)
(Ezekiel,16,11,I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.~)
(Ezekiel,16,12,And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.~)
(Ezekiel,16,13,Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.~)
(Ezekiel,16,14,And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,16,15,But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.~)
(Ezekiel,16,16,And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.~)
(Ezekiel,16,17,Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,~)
(Ezekiel,16,18,And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.~)
(Ezekiel,16,19,My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,16,20,Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,~)
(Ezekiel,16,21,That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?~)
(Ezekiel,16,22,And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.~)
(Ezekiel,16,23,And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee!  saith the LORD GOD;)~)
(Ezekiel,16,24,That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.~)
(Ezekiel,16,25,Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.~)
(Ezekiel,16,26,Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.~)
(Ezekiel,16,27,Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.~)
(Ezekiel,16,28,Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.~)
(Ezekiel,16,29,Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.~)
(Ezekiel,16,30,How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;~)
(Ezekiel,16,31,In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;~)
(Ezekiel,16,32,But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!~)
(Ezekiel,16,33,They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.~)
(Ezekiel,16,34,And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.~)
(Ezekiel,16,35,Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:~)
(Ezekiel,16,36,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;~)
(Ezekiel,16,37,Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.~)
(Ezekiel,16,38,And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.~)
(Ezekiel,16,39,And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.~)
(Ezekiel,16,40,They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.~)
(Ezekiel,16,41,And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.~)
(Ezekiel,16,42,So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.~)
(Ezekiel,16,43,Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,16,44,Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.~)
(Ezekiel,16,45,Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.~)
(Ezekiel,16,46,And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.~)
(Ezekiel,16,47,Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.~)
(Ezekiel,16,48,As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.~)
(Ezekiel,16,49,Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.~)
(Ezekiel,16,50,And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.~)
(Ezekiel,16,51,Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.~)
(Ezekiel,16,52,Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.~)
(Ezekiel,16,53,When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:~)
(Ezekiel,16,54,That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.~)
(Ezekiel,16,55,When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.~)
(Ezekiel,16,56,For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,~)
(Ezekiel,16,57,Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.~)
(Ezekiel,16,58,Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,16,59,For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.~)
(Ezekiel,16,60,Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.~)
(Ezekiel,16,61,Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.~)
(Ezekiel,16,62,And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:~)
(Ezekiel,16,63,That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,17,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,17,2,Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;~)
(Ezekiel,17,3,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:~)
(Ezekiel,17,4,He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.~)
(Ezekiel,17,5,He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a willow tree.~)
(Ezekiel,17,6,And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.~)
(Ezekiel,17,7,There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.~)
(Ezekiel,17,8,It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.~)
(Ezekiel,17,9,Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,17,10,Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.~)
(Ezekiel,17,11,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,17,12,Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean?  tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;~)
(Ezekiel,17,13,And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:~)
(Ezekiel,17,14,That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.~)
(Ezekiel,17,15,But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?~)
(Ezekiel,17,16,As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.~)
(Ezekiel,17,17,Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:~)
(Ezekiel,17,18,Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.~)
(Ezekiel,17,19,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.~)
(Ezekiel,17,20,And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.~)
(Ezekiel,17,21,And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.~)
(Ezekiel,17,22,Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:~)
(Ezekiel,17,23,In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.~)
(Ezekiel,17,24,And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.~)
(Ezekiel,18,1,The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,18,2,What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge?~)
(Ezekiel,18,3,As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,18,4,Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.~)
(Ezekiel,18,5,But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,~)
(Ezekiel,18,6,And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,~)
(Ezekiel,18,7,And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;~)
(Ezekiel,18,8,He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,~)
(Ezekiel,18,9,Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,18,10,If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,~)
(Ezekiel,18,11,And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,~)
(Ezekiel,18,12,Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,~)
(Ezekiel,18,13,Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.~)
(Ezekiel,18,14,Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,~)
(Ezekiel,18,15,That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife,~)
(Ezekiel,18,16,Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,~)
(Ezekiel,18,17,That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.~)
(Ezekiel,18,18,As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,18,19,Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?  When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.~)
(Ezekiel,18,20,The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.~)
(Ezekiel,18,21,But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.~)
(Ezekiel,18,22,All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.~)
(Ezekiel,18,23,Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?~)
(Ezekiel,18,24,But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.~)
(Ezekiel,18,25,Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?~)
(Ezekiel,18,26,When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.~)
(Ezekiel,18,27,Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.~)
(Ezekiel,18,28,Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.~)
(Ezekiel,18,29,Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?~)
(Ezekiel,18,30,Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.~)
(Ezekiel,18,31,Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?~)
(Ezekiel,18,32,For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.~)
(Ezekiel,19,1,Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,~)
(Ezekiel,19,2,And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.~)
(Ezekiel,19,3,And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.~)
(Ezekiel,19,4,The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.~)
(Ezekiel,19,5,Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.~)
(Ezekiel,19,6,And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.~)
(Ezekiel,19,7,And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.~)
(Ezekiel,19,8,Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.~)
(Ezekiel,19,9,And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,19,10,Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.~)
(Ezekiel,19,11,And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.~)
(Ezekiel,19,12,But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.~)
(Ezekiel,19,13,And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.~)
(Ezekiel,19,14,And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.~)
(Ezekiel,20,1,And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.~)
(Ezekiel,20,2,Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,20,3,Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.~)
(Ezekiel,20,4,Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:~)
(Ezekiel,20,5,And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;~)
(Ezekiel,20,6,In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:~)
(Ezekiel,20,7,Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.~)
(Ezekiel,20,8,But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.~)
(Ezekiel,20,9,But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.~)
(Ezekiel,20,10,Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.~)
(Ezekiel,20,11,And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.~)
(Ezekiel,20,12,Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.~)
(Ezekiel,20,13,But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.~)
(Ezekiel,20,14,But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.~)
(Ezekiel,20,15,Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;~)
(Ezekiel,20,16,Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.~)
(Ezekiel,20,17,Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.~)
(Ezekiel,20,18,But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:~)
(Ezekiel,20,19,I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;~)
(Ezekiel,20,20,And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.~)
(Ezekiel,20,21,Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.~)
(Ezekiel,20,22,Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.~)
(Ezekiel,20,23,I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;~)
(Ezekiel,20,24,Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.~)
(Ezekiel,20,25,Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;~)
(Ezekiel,20,26,And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,20,27,Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.~)
(Ezekiel,20,28,For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.~)
(Ezekiel,20,29,Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name whereof is called Bamah unto this day.~)
(Ezekiel,20,30,Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?~)
(Ezekiel,20,31,For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.~)
(Ezekiel,20,32,And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.~)
(Ezekiel,20,33,As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:~)
(Ezekiel,20,34,And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.~)
(Ezekiel,20,35,And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.~)
(Ezekiel,20,36,Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,20,37,And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:~)
(Ezekiel,20,38,And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,20,39,As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.~)
(Ezekiel,20,40,For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.~)
(Ezekiel,20,41,I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.~)
(Ezekiel,20,42,And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.~)
(Ezekiel,20,43,And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.~)
(Ezekiel,20,44,And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,20,45,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,20,46,Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;~)
(Ezekiel,20,47,And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.~)
(Ezekiel,20,48,And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.~)
(Ezekiel,20,49,Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?~)
(Ezekiel,21,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,21,2,Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,~)
(Ezekiel,21,3,And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.~)
(Ezekiel,21,4,Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:~)
(Ezekiel,21,5,That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.~)
(Ezekiel,21,6,Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.~)
(Ezekiel,21,7,And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,21,8,Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,21,9,Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:~)
(Ezekiel,21,10,It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.~)
(Ezekiel,21,11,And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.~)
(Ezekiel,21,12,Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.~)
(Ezekiel,21,13,Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod?  it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,21,14,Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.~)
(Ezekiel,21,15,I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.~)
(Ezekiel,21,16,Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.~)
(Ezekiel,21,17,I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.~)
(Ezekiel,21,18,The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,21,19,Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.~)
(Ezekiel,21,20,Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.~)
(Ezekiel,21,21,For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.~)
(Ezekiel,21,22,At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.~)
(Ezekiel,21,23,And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.~)
(Ezekiel,21,24,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.~)
(Ezekiel,21,25,And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,~)
(Ezekiel,21,26,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.~)
(Ezekiel,21,27,I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.~)
(Ezekiel,21,28,And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:~)
(Ezekiel,21,29,Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.~)
(Ezekiel,21,30,Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.~)
(Ezekiel,21,31,And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.~)
(Ezekiel,21,32,Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.~)
(Ezekiel,22,1,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,22,2,Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,22,3,Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.~)
(Ezekiel,22,4,Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.~)
(Ezekiel,22,5,Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.~)
(Ezekiel,22,6,Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.~)
(Ezekiel,22,7,In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.~)
(Ezekiel,22,8,Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.~)
(Ezekiel,22,9,In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.~)
(Ezekiel,22,10,In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.~)
(Ezekiel,22,11,And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.~)
(Ezekiel,22,12,In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,22,13,Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.~)
(Ezekiel,22,14,Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.~)
(Ezekiel,22,15,And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.~)
(Ezekiel,22,16,And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,22,17,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,22,18,Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.~)
(Ezekiel,22,19,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.~)
(Ezekiel,22,20,As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.~)
(Ezekiel,22,21,Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst therof.~)
(Ezekiel,22,22,As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.~)
(Ezekiel,22,23,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,22,24,Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.~)
(Ezekiel,22,25,There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,22,26,Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.~)
(Ezekiel,22,27,Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.~)
(Ezekiel,22,28,And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.~)
(Ezekiel,22,29,The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.~)
(Ezekiel,22,30,And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.~)
(Ezekiel,22,31,Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,23,1,The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,23,2,Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:~)
(Ezekiel,23,3,And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.~)
(Ezekiel,23,4,And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.~)
(Ezekiel,23,5,And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,~)
(Ezekiel,23,6,Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.~)
(Ezekiel,23,7,Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.~)
(Ezekiel,23,8,Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.~)
(Ezekiel,23,9,Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.~)
(Ezekiel,23,10,These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.~)
(Ezekiel,23,11,And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.~)
(Ezekiel,23,12,She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.~)
(Ezekiel,23,13,Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,~)
(Ezekiel,23,14,And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,~)
(Ezekiel,23,15,Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:~)
(Ezekiel,23,16,And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.~)
(Ezekiel,23,17,And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.~)
(Ezekiel,23,18,So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.~)
(Ezekiel,23,19,Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.~)
(Ezekiel,23,20,For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.~)
(Ezekiel,23,21,Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.~)
(Ezekiel,23,22,Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;~)
(Ezekiel,23,23,The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.~)
(Ezekiel,23,24,And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.~)
(Ezekiel,23,25,And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.~)
(Ezekiel,23,26,They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.~)
(Ezekiel,23,27,Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.~)
(Ezekiel,23,28,For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:~)
(Ezekiel,23,29,And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.~)
(Ezekiel,23,30,I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.~)
(Ezekiel,23,31,Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.~)
(Ezekiel,23,32,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.~)
(Ezekiel,23,33,Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.~)
(Ezekiel,23,34,Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,23,35,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.~)
(Ezekiel,23,36,The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;~)
(Ezekiel,23,37,That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.~)
(Ezekiel,23,38,Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.~)
(Ezekiel,23,39,For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.~)
(Ezekiel,23,40,And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,~)
(Ezekiel,23,41,And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.~)
(Ezekiel,23,42,And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.~)
(Ezekiel,23,43,Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?~)
(Ezekiel,23,44,Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.~)
(Ezekiel,23,45,And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.~)
(Ezekiel,23,46,For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.~)
(Ezekiel,23,47,And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.~)
(Ezekiel,23,48,Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.~)
(Ezekiel,23,49,And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,24,1,Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,24,2,Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.~)
(Ezekiel,24,3,And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:~)
(Ezekiel,24,4,Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.~)
(Ezekiel,24,5,Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.~)
(Ezekiel,24,6,Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.~)
(Ezekiel,24,7,For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;~)
(Ezekiel,24,8,That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.~)

(Ezekiel,24,10,Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.~)
(Ezekiel,24,11,Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.~)
(Ezekiel,24,12,She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.~)

(Ezekiel,24,22,And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.~)
(Ezekiel,24,23,And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.~)

(Ezekiel,25,8,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;~)
(Ezekiel,25,9,Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,~)
(Ezekiel,25,10,Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.~)

(Ezekiel,30,23,And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.~)
(Ezekiel,30,24,And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.~)
(Ezekiel,30,25,But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.~)
(Ezekiel,30,26,And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,31,1,And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,31,2,Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?~)
(Ezekiel,31,3,Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.~)
(Ezekiel,31,4,The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.~)
(Ezekiel,31,5,Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.~)
(Ezekiel,31,6,All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.~)
(Ezekiel,31,7,Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.~)
(Ezekiel,31,8,The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.~)
(Ezekiel,31,9,I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.~)
(Ezekiel,31,10,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;~)
(Ezekiel,31,11,I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.~)
(Ezekiel,31,12,And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.~)
(Ezekiel,31,13,Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:~)
(Ezekiel,31,14,To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.~)
(Ezekiel,31,15,Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.~)
(Ezekiel,31,16,I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.~)
(Ezekiel,31,17,They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen.~)
(Ezekiel,31,18,To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,32,1,And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,32,2,Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.~)
(Ezekiel,32,3,Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.~)
(Ezekiel,32,4,Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.~)
(Ezekiel,32,5,And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.~)
(Ezekiel,32,6,I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.~)
(Ezekiel,32,7,And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.~)
(Ezekiel,32,8,All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,32,9,I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.~)
(Ezekiel,32,10,Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.~)
(Ezekiel,32,11,For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.~)
(Ezekiel,32,12,By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.~)
(Ezekiel,32,13,I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.~)
(Ezekiel,32,14,Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,32,15,When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,32,16,This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,32,17,It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,32,18,Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.~)
(Ezekiel,32,19,Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.~)
(Ezekiel,32,20,They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.~)
(Ezekiel,32,21,The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword.~)
(Ezekiel,32,22,Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword:~)
(Ezekiel,32,23,Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.~)
(Ezekiel,32,24,There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.~)
(Ezekiel,32,25,They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.~)
(Ezekiel,32,26,There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.~)
(Ezekiel,32,27,And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.~)
(Ezekiel,32,28,Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.~)
(Ezekiel,32,29,There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.~)
(Ezekiel,32,30,There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.~)
(Ezekiel,32,31,Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,32,32,For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,33,1,Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,33,2,Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:~)
(Ezekiel,33,3,If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;~)
(Ezekiel,33,4,Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.~)
(Ezekiel,33,5,He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.~)
(Ezekiel,33,6,But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.~)
(Ezekiel,33,7,So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.~)
(Ezekiel,33,8,When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.~)
(Ezekiel,33,9,Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.~)
(Ezekiel,33,10,Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live?~)
(Ezekiel,33,11,Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?~)
(Ezekiel,33,12,Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.~)
(Ezekiel,33,13,When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.~)
(Ezekiel,33,14,Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;~)
(Ezekiel,33,15,If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.~)
(Ezekiel,33,16,None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.~)
(Ezekiel,33,17,Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.~)
(Ezekiel,33,18,When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby.~)
(Ezekiel,33,19,But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.~)
(Ezekiel,33,20,Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.~)
(Ezekiel,33,21,And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.~)
(Ezekiel,33,22,Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.~)
(Ezekiel,33,23,Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,33,24,Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.~)
(Ezekiel,33,25,Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?~)
(Ezekiel,33,26,Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?~)
(Ezekiel,33,27,Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.~)
(Ezekiel,33,28,For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.~)
(Ezekiel,33,29,Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed.~)
(Ezekiel,33,30,Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,33,31,And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.~)
(Ezekiel,33,32,And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.~)
(Ezekiel,33,33,And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.~)
(Ezekiel,34,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,34,2,Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?~)
(Ezekiel,34,3,Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.~)
(Ezekiel,34,4,The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.~)
(Ezekiel,34,5,And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.~)
(Ezekiel,34,6,My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them.~)
(Ezekiel,34,7,Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;~)
(Ezekiel,34,8,As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;~)
(Ezekiel,34,9,Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;~)
(Ezekiel,34,10,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.~)
(Ezekiel,34,11,For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.~)
(Ezekiel,34,12,As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.~)
(Ezekiel,34,13,And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.~)
(Ezekiel,34,14,I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,34,15,I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,34,16,I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.~)
(Ezekiel,34,17,And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.~)
(Ezekiel,34,18,Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?~)
(Ezekiel,34,19,And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.~)
(Ezekiel,34,20,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.~)
(Ezekiel,34,21,Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;~)
(Ezekiel,34,22,Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.~)
(Ezekiel,34,23,And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.~)
(Ezekiel,34,24,And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.~)
(Ezekiel,34,25,And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.~)
(Ezekiel,34,26,And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.~)
(Ezekiel,34,27,And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.~)
(Ezekiel,34,28,And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.~)
(Ezekiel,34,29,And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.~)
(Ezekiel,34,30,Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,34,31,And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,35,1,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,35,2,Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,~)
(Ezekiel,35,3,And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.~)
(Ezekiel,35,4,I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,35,5,Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:~)
(Ezekiel,35,6,Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.~)
(Ezekiel,35,7,Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.~)
(Ezekiel,35,8,And I will fill his mountains with his slain men: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.~)
(Ezekiel,35,9,I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,35,10,Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:~)
(Ezekiel,35,11,Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.~)
(Ezekiel,35,12,And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.~)
(Ezekiel,35,13,Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them.~)
(Ezekiel,35,14,Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.~)
(Ezekiel,35,15,As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,36,1,Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:~)
(Ezekiel,36,2,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:~)
(Ezekiel,36,3,Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:~)
(Ezekiel,36,4,Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about;~)
(Ezekiel,36,5,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey.~)
(Ezekiel,36,6,Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:~)
(Ezekiel,36,7,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.~)
(Ezekiel,36,8,But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come.~)
(Ezekiel,36,9,For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:~)
(Ezekiel,36,10,And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be builded:~)
(Ezekiel,36,11,And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,36,12,Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.~)
(Ezekiel,36,13,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations:~)
(Ezekiel,36,14,Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,36,15,Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,36,16,Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,36,17,Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.~)
(Ezekiel,36,18,Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:~)
(Ezekiel,36,19,And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.~)
(Ezekiel,36,20,And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.~)
(Ezekiel,36,21,But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.~)
(Ezekiel,36,22,Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.~)
(Ezekiel,36,23,And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.~)
(Ezekiel,36,24,For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.~)
(Ezekiel,36,25,Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.~)
(Ezekiel,36,26,A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.~)
(Ezekiel,36,27,And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.~)
(Ezekiel,36,28,And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.~)
(Ezekiel,36,29,I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.~)
(Ezekiel,36,30,And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.~)
(Ezekiel,36,31,Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,36,32,Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,36,33,Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.~)
(Ezekiel,36,34,And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by.~)
(Ezekiel,36,35,And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.~)
(Ezekiel,36,36,Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.~)
(Ezekiel,36,37,Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock.~)
(Ezekiel,36,38,As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,37,1,The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones,~)
(Ezekiel,37,2,And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.~)
(Ezekiel,37,3,And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.~)
(Ezekiel,37,4,Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,37,5,Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:~)
(Ezekiel,37,6,And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,37,7,So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.~)
(Ezekiel,37,8,And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them.~)
(Ezekiel,37,9,Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.~)
(Ezekiel,37,10,So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.~)
(Ezekiel,37,11,Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.~)
(Ezekiel,37,12,Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,37,13,And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,~)
(Ezekiel,37,14,And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,37,15,The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,37,16,Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his companions:~)
(Ezekiel,37,17,And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.~)
(Ezekiel,37,18,And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?~)
(Ezekiel,37,19,Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.~)
(Ezekiel,37,20,And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.~)
(Ezekiel,37,21,And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:~)
(Ezekiel,37,22,And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.~)
(Ezekiel,37,23,Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.~)
(Ezekiel,37,24,And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.~)
(Ezekiel,37,25,And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever.~)
(Ezekiel,37,26,Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.~)
(Ezekiel,37,27,My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.~)
(Ezekiel,37,28,And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.~)
(Ezekiel,38,1,And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,~)
(Ezekiel,38,2,Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,~)
(Ezekiel,38,3,And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:~)
(Ezekiel,38,4,And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:~)
(Ezekiel,38,5,Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet:~)
(Ezekiel,38,6,Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.~)
(Ezekiel,38,7,Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.~)
(Ezekiel,38,8,After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.~)
(Ezekiel,38,9,Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee.~)
(Ezekiel,38,10,Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought:~)
(Ezekiel,38,11,And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,~)
(Ezekiel,38,12,To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.~)
(Ezekiel,38,13,Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?~)
(Ezekiel,38,14,Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it?~)
(Ezekiel,38,15,And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:~)
(Ezekiel,38,16,And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.~)
(Ezekiel,38,17,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee against them?~)
(Ezekiel,38,18,And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury shall come up in my face.~)
(Ezekiel,38,19,For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel;~)
(Ezekiel,38,20,So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.~)
(Ezekiel,38,21,And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be against his brother.~)
(Ezekiel,38,22,And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.~)
(Ezekiel,38,23,Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,39,1,Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:~)
(Ezekiel,39,2,And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:~)
(Ezekiel,39,3,And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.~)
(Ezekiel,39,4,Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.~)
(Ezekiel,39,5,Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,39,6,And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,39,7,So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,39,8,Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.~)
(Ezekiel,39,9,And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:~)
(Ezekiel,39,10,So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,39,11,And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.~)
(Ezekiel,39,12,And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.~)
(Ezekiel,39,13,Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,39,14,And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.~)
(Ezekiel,39,15,And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.~)
(Ezekiel,39,16,And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.~)
(Ezekiel,39,17,And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.~)
(Ezekiel,39,18,Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.~)
(Ezekiel,39,19,And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.~)
(Ezekiel,39,20,Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,39,21,And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.~)
(Ezekiel,39,22,So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.~)
(Ezekiel,39,23,And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.~)
(Ezekiel,39,24,According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.~)
(Ezekiel,39,25,Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;~)
(Ezekiel,39,26,After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.~)
(Ezekiel,39,27,When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;~)
(Ezekiel,39,28,Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.~)
(Ezekiel,39,29,Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,40,1,In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither.~)
(Ezekiel,40,2,In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south.~)
(Ezekiel,40,3,And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.~)
(Ezekiel,40,4,And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,40,5,And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.~)
(Ezekiel,40,6,Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.~)
(Ezekiel,40,7,And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.~)
(Ezekiel,40,8,He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.~)
(Ezekiel,40,9,Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.~)
(Ezekiel,40,10,And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.~)
(Ezekiel,40,11,And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,12,The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.~)
(Ezekiel,40,13,He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.~)
(Ezekiel,40,14,He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.~)
(Ezekiel,40,15,And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,16,And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.~)
(Ezekiel,40,17,Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.~)
(Ezekiel,40,18,And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.~)
(Ezekiel,40,19,Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.~)
(Ezekiel,40,20,And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,40,21,And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,22,And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.~)
(Ezekiel,40,23,And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,24,After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.~)
(Ezekiel,40,25,And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,26,And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,40,27,And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,28,And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;~)
(Ezekiel,40,29,And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.~)
(Ezekiel,40,30,And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.~)
(Ezekiel,40,31,And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.~)
(Ezekiel,40,32,And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.~)
(Ezekiel,40,33,And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.~)
(Ezekiel,40,34,And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.~)
(Ezekiel,40,35,And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;~)
(Ezekiel,40,36,The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,40,37,And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.~)
(Ezekiel,40,38,And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.~)
(Ezekiel,40,39,And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.~)
(Ezekiel,40,40,And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.~)
(Ezekiel,40,41,Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.~)
(Ezekiel,40,42,And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.~)
(Ezekiel,40,43,And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.~)
(Ezekiel,40,44,And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.~)
(Ezekiel,40,45,And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.~)
(Ezekiel,40,46,And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.~)
(Ezekiel,40,47,So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.~)
(Ezekiel,40,48,And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.~)
(Ezekiel,40,49,The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.~)
(Ezekiel,41,1,Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.~)
(Ezekiel,41,2,And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,41,3,Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,41,4,So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.~)
(Ezekiel,41,5,After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.~)
(Ezekiel,41,6,And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.~)
(Ezekiel,41,7,And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.~)
(Ezekiel,41,8,I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,41,9,The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within.~)
(Ezekiel,41,10,And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.~)
(Ezekiel,41,11,And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.~)
(Ezekiel,41,12,Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,41,13,So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;~)
(Ezekiel,41,14,Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,41,15,And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;~)
(Ezekiel,41,16,The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;~)
(Ezekiel,41,17,To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.~)
(Ezekiel,41,18,And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;~)
(Ezekiel,41,19,So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.~)
(Ezekiel,41,20,From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.~)
(Ezekiel,41,21,The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.~)
(Ezekiel,41,22,The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,41,23,And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.~)
(Ezekiel,41,24,And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.~)
(Ezekiel,41,25,And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.~)
(Ezekiel,41,26,And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.~)
(Ezekiel,42,1,Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.~)
(Ezekiel,42,2,Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the breadth was fifty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,42,3,Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery against gallery in three stories.~)
(Ezekiel,42,4,And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.~)
(Ezekiel,42,5,Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.~)
(Ezekiel,42,6,For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.~)
(Ezekiel,42,7,And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,42,8,For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.~)
(Ezekiel,42,9,And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.~)
(Ezekiel,42,10,The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.~)
(Ezekiel,42,11,And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.~)
(Ezekiel,42,12,And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.~)
(Ezekiel,42,13,Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.~)
(Ezekiel,42,14,When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.~)
(Ezekiel,42,15,Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about.~)
(Ezekiel,42,16,He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.~)
(Ezekiel,42,17,He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.~)
(Ezekiel,42,18,He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.~)
(Ezekiel,42,19,He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.~)
(Ezekiel,42,20,He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.~)
(Ezekiel,43,1,Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east:~)
(Ezekiel,43,2,And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.~)
(Ezekiel,43,3,And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.~)
(Ezekiel,43,4,And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east.~)
(Ezekiel,43,5,So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.~)
(Ezekiel,43,6,And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.~)
(Ezekiel,43,7,And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.~)
(Ezekiel,43,8,In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.~)
(Ezekiel,43,9,Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.~)
(Ezekiel,43,10,Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.~)
(Ezekiel,43,11,And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.~)
(Ezekiel,43,12,This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.~)
(Ezekiel,43,13,And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar.~)
(Ezekiel,43,14,And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit.~)
(Ezekiel,43,15,So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns.~)
(Ezekiel,43,16,And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,43,17,And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.~)
(Ezekiel,43,18,And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.~)
(Ezekiel,43,19,And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.~)
(Ezekiel,43,20,And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.~)
(Ezekiel,43,21,Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.~)
(Ezekiel,43,22,And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.~)
(Ezekiel,43,23,When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.~)
(Ezekiel,43,24,And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,43,25,Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.~)
(Ezekiel,43,26,Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.~)
(Ezekiel,43,27,And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,44,1,Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.~)
(Ezekiel,44,2,Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.~)
(Ezekiel,44,3,It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.~)
(Ezekiel,44,4,Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.~)
(Ezekiel,44,5,And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.~)
(Ezekiel,44,6,And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice you of all your abominations,~)
(Ezekiel,44,7,In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.~)
(Ezekiel,44,8,And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.~)
(Ezekiel,44,9,Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,44,10,And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear their iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,44,11,Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.~)
(Ezekiel,44,12,Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall bear their iniquity.~)
(Ezekiel,44,13,And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.~)
(Ezekiel,44,14,But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.~)
(Ezekiel,44,15,But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD:~)
(Ezekiel,44,16,They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.~)
(Ezekiel,44,17,And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.~)
(Ezekiel,44,18,They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.~)
(Ezekiel,44,19,And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.~)
(Ezekiel,44,20,Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.~)
(Ezekiel,44,21,Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.~)
(Ezekiel,44,22,Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.~)
(Ezekiel,44,23,And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.~)
(Ezekiel,44,24,And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.~)
(Ezekiel,44,25,And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.~)
(Ezekiel,44,26,And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.~)
(Ezekiel,44,27,And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,44,28,And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.~)
(Ezekiel,44,29,They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be theirs.~)
(Ezekiel,44,30,And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.~)
(Ezekiel,44,31,The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.~)
(Ezekiel,45,1,Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.~)
(Ezekiel,45,2,Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,45,3,And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.~)
(Ezekiel,45,4,The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.~)
(Ezekiel,45,5,And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.~)
(Ezekiel,45,6,And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,45,7,And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border.~)
(Ezekiel,45,8,In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.~)
(Ezekiel,45,9,Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,45,10,Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.~)
(Ezekiel,45,11,The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.~)
(Ezekiel,45,12,And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.~)
(Ezekiel,45,13,This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley:~)
(Ezekiel,45,14,Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:~)
(Ezekiel,45,15,And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,45,16,All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,45,17,And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,45,18,Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary:~)
(Ezekiel,45,19,And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.~)
(Ezekiel,45,20,And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye reconcile the house.~)
(Ezekiel,45,21,In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.~)
(Ezekiel,45,22,And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.~)
(Ezekiel,45,23,And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering.~)
(Ezekiel,45,24,And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah.~)
(Ezekiel,45,25,In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.~)
(Ezekiel,46,1,Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.~)
(Ezekiel,46,2,And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.~)
(Ezekiel,46,3,Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons.~)
(Ezekiel,46,4,And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.~)
(Ezekiel,46,5,And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.~)
(Ezekiel,46,6,And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.~)
(Ezekiel,46,7,And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.~)
(Ezekiel,46,8,And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way thereof.~)
(Ezekiel,46,9,But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over against it.~)
(Ezekiel,46,10,And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.~)
(Ezekiel,46,11,And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah.~)
(Ezekiel,46,12,Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.~)
(Ezekiel,46,13,Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning.~)
(Ezekiel,46,14,And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.~)
(Ezekiel,46,15,Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.~)
(Ezekiel,46,16,Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.~)
(Ezekiel,46,17,But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be his sons' for them.~)
(Ezekiel,46,18,Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.~)
(Ezekiel,46,19,After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.~)
(Ezekiel,46,20,Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people.~)
(Ezekiel,46,21,Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.~)
(Ezekiel,46,22,In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.~)
(Ezekiel,46,23,And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about.~)
(Ezekiel,46,24,Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.~)
(Ezekiel,47,1,Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar.~)
(Ezekiel,47,2,Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.~)
(Ezekiel,47,3,And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.~)
(Ezekiel,47,4,Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.~)
(Ezekiel,47,5,Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed over.~)
(Ezekiel,47,6,And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.~)
(Ezekiel,47,7,Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.~)
(Ezekiel,47,8,Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be healed.~)
(Ezekiel,47,9,And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live whither the river cometh.~)
(Ezekiel,47,10,And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.~)
(Ezekiel,47,11,But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.~)
(Ezekiel,47,12,And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.~)
(Ezekiel,47,13,Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.~)
(Ezekiel,47,14,And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.~)
(Ezekiel,47,15,And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;~)
(Ezekiel,47,16,Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.~)
(Ezekiel,47,17,And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side.~)
(Ezekiel,47,18,And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side.~)
(Ezekiel,47,19,And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward.~)
(Ezekiel,47,20,The west side also shall be the great sea from the border, till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.~)
(Ezekiel,47,21,So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,47,22,And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.~)
(Ezekiel,47,23,And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD.~)
(Ezekiel,48,1,Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan.~)
(Ezekiel,48,2,And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Asher.~)

(Matthew,7,15,Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.~)

(Matthew,12,11,And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?~)
(Matthew,12,12,How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.~)
(Matthew,12,13,Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.~)
(Matthew,12,14,Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.~)
(Matthew,12,15,But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;~)
(Matthew,12,16,And charged them that they should not make him known:~)
(Matthew,12,17,That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,~)
(Matthew,12,18,Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.~)
(Matthew,12,19,He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.~)
(Matthew,12,20,A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.~)
(Matthew,12,21,And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.~)

(Matthew,12,23,And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?~)
(Matthew,12,24,But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.~)
(Matthew,12,25,And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:~)
(Matthew,12,26,And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?~)
(Matthew,12,27,And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.~)
(Matthew,12,28,But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.~)
(Matthew,12,29,Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.~)

(Matthew,12,34,O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.~)
(Matthew,12,35,A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.~)
(Matthew,12,36,But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.~)
(Matthew,12,37,For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.~)
(Matthew,12,38,Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.~)
(Matthew,12,39,But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:~)
(Matthew,12,40,For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.~)
(Matthew,12,41,The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.~)
(Matthew,12,42,The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.~)
(Matthew,12,43,When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.~)
(Matthew,12,44,Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.~)
(Matthew,12,45,Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.~)
(Matthew,12,46,While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.~)
(Matthew,12,47,Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.~)
(Matthew,12,48,But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother?  and who are my brethren?~)
(Matthew,12,49,And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!~)
(Matthew,12,50,For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.~)
(Matthew,13,1,The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.~)
(Matthew,13,2,And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.~)
(Matthew,13,3,And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;~)
(Matthew,13,4,And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:~)
(Matthew,13,5,Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:~)
(Matthew,13,6,And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.~)

(Matthew,13,8,But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.~)
(Matthew,13,9,Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.~)
(Matthew,13,10,And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?~)
(Matthew,13,11,He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.~)
(Matthew,13,12,For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.~)
(Matthew,13,13,Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.~)
(Matthew,13,14,And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:~)
(Matthew,13,15,For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.~)
(Matthew,13,16,But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.~)
(Matthew,13,17,For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.~)
(Matthew,13,18,Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.~)
(Matthew,13,19,When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.~)
(Matthew,13,20,But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;~)
(Matthew,13,21,Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.~)
(Matthew,13,22,He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.~)
(Matthew,13,23,But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.~)
(Matthew,13,24,Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:~)
(Matthew,13,25,But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.~)
(Matthew,13,26,But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.~)
(Matthew,13,27,So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?~)
(Matthew,13,28,He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?~)
(Matthew,13,29,But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.~)
(Matthew,13,30,Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.~)
(Matthew,13,31,Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:~)
(Matthew,13,32,Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.~)
(Matthew,13,33,Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.~)
(Matthew,13,34,All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:~)
(Matthew,13,35,That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.~)
(Matthew,13,36,Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.~)
(Matthew,13,37,He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;~)
(Matthew,13,38,The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;~)
(Matthew,13,39,The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.~)
(Matthew,13,40,As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.~)
(Matthew,13,41,The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;~)
(Matthew,13,42,And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.~)
(Matthew,13,43,Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.~)
(Matthew,13,44,Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.~)
(Matthew,13,45,Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:~)
(Matthew,13,46,Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.~)
(Matthew,13,47,Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:~)
(Matthew,13,48,Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.~)
(Matthew,13,49,So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,~)
(Matthew,13,50,And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.~)
(Matthew,13,51,Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.~)
(Matthew,13,52,Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.~)
(Matthew,13,53,And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.~)
(Matthew,13,54,And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?~)
(Matthew,13,55,Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?~)
(Matthew,13,56,And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?~)
(Matthew,13,57,And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.~)
(Matthew,13,58,And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.~)
(Matthew,14,1,At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,~)
(Matthew,14,2,And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.~)
(Matthew,14,3,For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.~)
(Matthew,14,4,For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.~)
(Matthew,14,5,And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.~)
(Matthew,14,6,But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.~)
(Matthew,14,7,Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.~)
(Matthew,14,8,And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.~)
(Matthew,14,9,And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.~)
(Matthew,14,10,And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.~)
(Matthew,14,11,And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.~)
(Matthew,14,12,And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.~)
(Matthew,14,13,When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.~)
(Matthew,14,14,And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.~)
(Matthew,14,15,And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.~)
(Matthew,14,16,But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.~)
(Matthew,14,17,And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.~)
(Matthew,14,18,He said, Bring them hither to me.~)
(Matthew,14,19,And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.~)
(Matthew,14,20,And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.~)
(Matthew,14,21,And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.~)
(Matthew,14,22,And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.~)
(Matthew,14,23,And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.~)
(Matthew,14,24,But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.~)
(Matthew,14,25,And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.~)
(Matthew,14,26,And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.~)
(Matthew,14,27,But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.~)
(Matthew,14,28,And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.~)
(Matthew,14,29,And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.~)
(Matthew,14,30,But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.~)
(Matthew,14,31,And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?~)
(Matthew,14,32,And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.~)
(Matthew,14,33,Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.~)
(Matthew,14,34,And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.~)
(Matthew,14,35,And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;~)
(Matthew,14,36,And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.~)
(Matthew,15,1,Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,~)
(Matthew,15,2,Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.~)
(Matthew,15,3,But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?~)
(Matthew,15,4,For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.~)
(Matthew,15,5,But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;~)
(Matthew,15,6,And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.~)
(Matthew,15,7,Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,~)
(Matthew,15,8,This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.~)
(Matthew,15,9,But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.~)
(Matthew,15,10,And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:~)
(Matthew,15,11,Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.~)
(Matthew,15,12,Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?~)
(Matthew,15,13,But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.~)
(Matthew,15,14,Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.~)
(Matthew,15,15,Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.~)
(Matthew,15,16,And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?~)
(Matthew,15,17,Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?~)
(Matthew,15,18,But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.~)
(Matthew,15,19,For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:~)
(Matthew,15,20,These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.~)
(Matthew,15,21,Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.~)
(Matthew,15,22,And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.~)
(Matthew,15,23,But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.~)
(Matthew,15,24,But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.~)
(Matthew,15,25,Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.~)
(Matthew,15,26,But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.~)
(Matthew,15,27,And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.~)
(Matthew,15,28,Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.~)
(Matthew,15,29,And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.~)
(Matthew,15,30,And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:~)
(Matthew,15,31,Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.~)
(Matthew,15,32,Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.~)
(Matthew,15,33,And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?~)
(Matthew,15,34,And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.~)
(Matthew,15,35,And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.~)
(Matthew,15,36,And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.~)
(Matthew,15,37,And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.~)
(Matthew,15,38,And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.~)
(Matthew,15,39,And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.~)
(Matthew,16,1,The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.~)
(Matthew,16,2,He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.~)
(Matthew,16,3,And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?~)
(Matthew,16,4,A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.~)
(Matthew,16,5,And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.~)
(Matthew,16,6,Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.~)
(Matthew,16,7,And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.~)
(Matthew,16,8,Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?~)
(Matthew,16,9,Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?~)
(Matthew,16,10,Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?~)
(Matthew,16,11,How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?~)
(Matthew,16,12,Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.~)
(Matthew,16,13,When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?~)
(Matthew,16,14,And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.~)
(Matthew,16,15,He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?~)
(Matthew,16,16,And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.~)
(Matthew,16,17,And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.~)
(Matthew,16,18,And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.~)
(Matthew,16,19,And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.~)
(Matthew,16,20,Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.~)
(Matthew,16,21,From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.~)
(Matthew,16,22,Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.~)
(Matthew,16,23,But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.~)
(Matthew,16,24,Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.~)
(Matthew,16,25,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.~)
(Matthew,16,26,For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?~)
(Matthew,16,27,For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.~)

(Matthew,17,5,While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.~)

(Matthew,17,10,And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?~)
(Matthew,17,11,And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.~)
(Matthew,17,12,But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.~)
(Matthew,17,13,Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.~)
(Matthew,17,14,And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,~)
(Matthew,17,15,Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.~)
(Matthew,17,16,And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.~)
(Matthew,17,17,Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.~)
(Matthew,17,18,And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.~)
(Matthew,17,19,Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?~)
(Matthew,17,20,And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.~)
(Matthew,17,21,Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.~)
(Matthew,17,22,And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:~)

(Matthew,17,24,And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?~)
(Matthew,17,25,He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?~)
(Matthew,17,26,Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.~)
(Matthew,17,27,Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.~)
(Matthew,18,1,At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?~)
(Matthew,18,2,And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,~)
(Matthew,18,3,And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.~)
(Matthew,18,4,Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.~)
(Matthew,18,5,And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.~)
(Matthew,18,6,But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.~)
(Matthew,18,7,Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!~)
(Matthew,18,8,Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.~)
(Matthew,18,9,And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.~)
(Matthew,18,10,Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.~)
(Matthew,18,11,For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.~)
(Matthew,18,12,How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?~)
(Matthew,18,13,And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.~)
(Matthew,18,14,Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.~)
(Matthew,18,15,Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.~)

(Matthew,18,22,Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.~)
(Matthew,18,23,Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.~)
(Matthew,18,24,And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.~)
(Matthew,18,25,But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.~)
(Matthew,18,26,The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.~)
(Matthew,18,27,Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.~)
(Matthew,18,28,But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.~)
(Matthew,18,29,And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.~)
(Matthew,18,30,And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.~)
(Matthew,18,31,So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.~)
(Matthew,18,32,Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:~)
(Matthew,18,33,Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?~)
(Matthew,18,34,And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.~)
(Matthew,18,35,So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.~)
(Matthew,19,1,And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;~)
(Matthew,19,2,And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.~)
(Matthew,19,3,The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?~)
(Matthew,19,4,And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,~)
(Matthew,19,5,And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?~)
(Matthew,19,6,Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.~)
(Matthew,19,7,They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?~)
(Matthew,19,8,He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.~)
(Matthew,19,9,And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.~)
(Matthew,19,10,His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.~)
(Matthew,19,11,But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.~)
(Matthew,19,12,For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.~)
(Matthew,19,13,Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.~)
(Matthew,19,14,But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.~)
(Matthew,19,15,And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.~)
(Matthew,19,16,And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?~)
(Matthew,19,17,And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.~)
(Matthew,19,18,He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,~)
(Matthew,19,19,Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.~)
(Matthew,19,20,The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?~)
(Matthew,19,21,Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.~)
(Matthew,19,22,But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.~)
(Matthew,19,23,Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.~)
(Matthew,19,24,And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.~)
(Matthew,19,25,When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?~)
(Matthew,19,26,But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.~)
(Matthew,19,27,Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?~)
(Matthew,19,28,And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.~)
(Matthew,19,29,And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.~)
(Matthew,19,30,But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.~)
(Matthew,20,1,For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.~)
(Matthew,20,2,And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.~)
(Matthew,20,3,And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,~)
(Matthew,20,4,And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.~)
(Matthew,20,5,Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.~)
(Matthew,20,6,And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?~)
(Matthew,20,7,They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.~)
(Matthew,20,8,So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.~)
(Matthew,20,9,And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.~)
(Matthew,20,10,But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.~)
(Matthew,20,11,And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,~)
(Matthew,20,12,Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.~)
(Matthew,20,13,But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?~)
(Matthew,20,14,Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.~)
(Matthew,20,15,Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?~)
(Matthew,20,16,So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.~)
(Matthew,20,17,And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,~)
(Matthew,20,18,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,~)
(Matthew,20,19,And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.~)
(Matthew,20,20,Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.~)
(Matthew,20,21,And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.~)
(Matthew,20,22,But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.~)
(Matthew,20,23,And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.~)
(Matthew,20,24,And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.~)
(Matthew,20,25,But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.~)
(Matthew,20,26,But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;~)
(Matthew,20,27,And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:~)
(Matthew,20,28,Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.~)
(Matthew,20,29,And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.~)
(Matthew,20,30,And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.~)
(Matthew,20,31,And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.~)
(Matthew,20,32,And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?~)
(Matthew,20,33,They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.~)

(Matthew,21,1,And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,~)
(Matthew,21,2,Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.~)
(Matthew,21,3,And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.~)
(Matthew,21,4,All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,~)

(Matthew,26,8,But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?~)
(Matthew,26,9,For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.~)
(Matthew,26,10,When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.~)
(Matthew,26,11,For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.~)
(Matthew,26,12,For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.~)

(Matthew,26,16,And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.~)
(Matthew,26,17,Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?~)

(Matthew,27,2,And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.~)
(Matthew,27,3,Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,~)
(Matthew,27,4,Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.~)
(Matthew,27,5,And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.~)
(Matthew,27,6,And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.~)
(Matthew,27,7,And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.~)
(Matthew,27,8,Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.~)
(Matthew,27,9,Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;~)
(Matthew,27,10,And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.~)
(Matthew,27,11,And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.~)
(Matthew,27,12,And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.~)
(Matthew,27,13,Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?~)
(Matthew,27,14,And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.~)
(Matthew,27,15,Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.~)
(Matthew,27,16,And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.~)
(Matthew,27,17,Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?~)
(Matthew,27,18,For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.~)
(Matthew,27,19,When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.~)
(Matthew,27,20,But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.~)
(Matthew,27,21,The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.~)
(Matthew,27,22,Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.~)
(Matthew,27,23,And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.~)
(Matthew,27,24,When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.~)
(Matthew,27,25,Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.~)
(Matthew,27,26,Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.~)
(Matthew,27,27,Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.~)
(Matthew,27,28,And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.~)
(Matthew,27,29,And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!~)
(Matthew,27,30,And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.~)
(Matthew,27,31,And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.~)
(Matthew,27,32,And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.~)
(Matthew,27,33,And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,~)
(Matthew,27,34,They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.~)
(Matthew,27,35,And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.~)
(Matthew,27,36,And sitting down they watched him there;~)
(Matthew,27,37,And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.~)
(Matthew,27,38,Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.~)
(Matthew,27,39,And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,~)
(Matthew,27,40,And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.~)
(Matthew,27,41,Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,~)
(Matthew,27,42,He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.~)
(Matthew,27,43,He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.~)
(Matthew,27,44,The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.~)
(Matthew,27,45,Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.~)
(Matthew,27,46,And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?~)
(Matthew,27,47,Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.~)
(Matthew,27,48,And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.~)
(Matthew,27,49,The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.~)
(Matthew,27,50,Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.~)
(Matthew,27,51,And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;~)
(Matthew,27,52,And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,~)
(Matthew,27,53,And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.~)
(Matthew,27,54,Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.~)
(Matthew,27,55,And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:~)
(Matthew,27,56,Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.~)
(Matthew,27,57,When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:~)
(Matthew,27,58,He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.~)
(Matthew,27,59,And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,~)
(Matthew,27,60,And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.~)
(Matthew,27,61,And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.~)
(Matthew,27,62,Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,~)
(Matthew,27,63,Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.~)
(Matthew,27,64,Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.~)
(Matthew,27,65,Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.~)
(Matthew,27,66,So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.~)
(Matthew,28,1,In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.~)
(Matthew,28,2,And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.~)
(Matthew,28,3,His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:~)
(Matthew,28,4,And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.~)
(Matthew,28,5,And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.~)
(Matthew,28,6,He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.~)
(Matthew,28,7,And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.~)
(Matthew,28,8,And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.~)
(Matthew,28,9,And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.~)
(Matthew,28,10,Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.~)
(Matthew,28,11,Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.~)
(Matthew,28,12,And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,~)
(Matthew,28,13,Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.~)
(Matthew,28,14,And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.~)
(Matthew,28,15,So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.~)
(Matthew,28,16,Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.~)
(Matthew,28,17,And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.~)
(Matthew,28,18,And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.~)
(Matthew,28,19,Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:~)
(Matthew,28,20,Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.~)
(Galatians,1,1,Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)~)
(Galatians,1,2,And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:~)
(Galatians,1,3,Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,~)
(Galatians,1,4,Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:~)
(Galatians,1,5,To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.~)
(Galatians,1,6,I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:~)
(Galatians,1,7,Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.~)
(Galatians,1,8,But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.~)
(Galatians,1,9,As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.~)
(Galatians,1,10,For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.~)
(Galatians,1,11,But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.~)
(Galatians,1,12,For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.~)
(Galatians,1,13,For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:~)
(Galatians,1,14,And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.~)
(Galatians,1,15,But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,~)
(Galatians,1,16,To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:~)
(Galatians,1,17,Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.~)
(Galatians,1,18,Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.~)
(Galatians,1,19,But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.~)
(Galatians,1,20,Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.~)
(Galatians,1,21,Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;~)
(Galatians,1,22,And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:~)
(Galatians,1,23,But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.~)
(Galatians,1,24,And they glorified God in me.~)
(Galatians,2,1,Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.~)
(Galatians,2,2,And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.~)
(Galatians,2,3,But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:~)
(Galatians,2,4,And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:~)
(Galatians,2,5,To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.~)
(Galatians,2,6,But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:~)
(Galatians,2,7,But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;~)
(Galatians,2,8,(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)~)
(Galatians,2,9,And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.~)
(Galatians,2,10,Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.~)
(Galatians,2,11,But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.~)
(Galatians,2,12,For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.~)
(Galatians,2,13,And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.~)
(Galatians,2,14,But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?~)
(Galatians,2,15,We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,~)
(Galatians,2,16,Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.~)
(Galatians,2,17,But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.~)
(Galatians,2,18,For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.~)
(Galatians,2,19,For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.~)
(Galatians,2,20,I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.~)
(Galatians,2,21,I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.~)
(Galatians,3,1,O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?~)
(Galatians,3,2,This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?~)
(Galatians,3,3,Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?~)
(Galatians,3,4,Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.~)
(Galatians,3,5,He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?~)
(Galatians,3,6,Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.~)
(Galatians,3,7,Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.~)
(Galatians,3,8,And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.~)
(Galatians,3,9,So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.~)
(Galatians,3,10,For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.~)
(Galatians,3,11,But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.~)
(Galatians,3,12,And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.~)
(Galatians,3,13,Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:~)
(Galatians,3,14,That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.~)
(Galatians,3,15,Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.~)
(Galatians,3,16,Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.~)
(Galatians,3,17,And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.~)
(Galatians,3,18,For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.~)
(Galatians,3,19,Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.~)
(Galatians,3,20,Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.~)
(Galatians,3,21,Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.~)
(Galatians,3,22,But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.~)
(Galatians,3,23,But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.~)
(Galatians,3,24,Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.~)
(Galatians,3,25,But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.~)
(Galatians,3,26,For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.~)
(Galatians,3,27,For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.~)
(Galatians,3,28,There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.~)
(Galatians,3,29,And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.~)
(Galatians,4,1,Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;~)
(Galatians,4,2,But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.~)
(Galatians,4,3,Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:~)
(Galatians,4,4,But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,~)
(Galatians,4,5,To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.~)
(Galatians,4,6,And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.~)
(Galatians,4,7,Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.~)
(Galatians,4,8,Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.~)
(Galatians,4,9,But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?~)
(Galatians,4,10,Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.~)
(Galatians,4,11,I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.~)
(Galatians,4,12,Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.~)
(Galatians,4,13,Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.~)
(Galatians,4,14,And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.~)
(Galatians,4,15,Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.~)
(Galatians,4,16,Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?~)
(Galatians,4,17,They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.~)
(Galatians,4,18,But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.~)
(Galatians,4,19,My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,~)
(Galatians,4,20,I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.~)
(Galatians,4,21,Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?~)
(Galatians,4,22,For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.~)
(Galatians,4,23,But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.~)
(Galatians,4,24,Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.~)
(Galatians,4,25,For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.~)
(Galatians,4,26,But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.~)
(Galatians,4,27,For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.~)
(Galatians,4,28,Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.~)
(Galatians,4,29,But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.~)
(Galatians,4,30,Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.~)
(Galatians,4,31,So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.~)
(Galatians,5,1,Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.~)
(Galatians,5,2,Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.~)
(Galatians,5,3,For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.~)
(Galatians,5,4,Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.~)
(Galatians,5,5,For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.~)
(Galatians,5,6,For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.~)
(Galatians,5,7,Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?~)
(Galatians,5,8,This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.~)
(Galatians,5,9,A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.~)
(Galatians,5,10,I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.~)
(Galatians,5,11,And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.~)
(Galatians,5,12,I would they were even cut off which trouble you.~)
(Galatians,5,13,For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.~)
(Galatians,5,14,For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.~)
(Galatians,5,15,But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.~)
(Galatians,5,16,This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.~)
(Galatians,5,17,For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.~)
(Galatians,5,18,But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.~)
(Galatians,5,19,Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,~)
(Galatians,5,20,Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,~)
(Galatians,5,21,Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.~)
(Galatians,5,22,But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,~)
(Galatians,5,23,Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.~)
(Galatians,5,24,And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.~)
(Galatians,5,25,If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.~)
(Galatians,5,26,Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.~)
(Galatians,6,1,Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.~)
(Galatians,6,2,Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.~)
(Galatians,6,3,For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.~)

(Mark,4,28,For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.~)
(Mark,4,29,But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.~)
(Mark,4,30,And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?~)

(Mark,4,35,And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.~)
(Mark,4,36,And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.~)
(Mark,4,37,And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.~)
(Mark,4,38,And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?~)

(Mark,4,40,And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?~)
(Mark,4,41,And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?~)
(Mark,5,1,And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.~)
(Mark,5,2,And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,~)
(Mark,5,3,Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:~)
(Mark,5,4,Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.~)
(Mark,5,5,And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.~)
(Mark,5,6,But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,~)
(Mark,5,7,And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.~)
(Mark,5,8,For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.~)
(Mark,5,9,And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.~)
(Mark,5,10,And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.~)
(Mark,5,11,Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.~)
(Mark,5,12,And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.~)
(Mark,5,13,And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.~)
(Mark,5,14,And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.~)
(Mark,5,15,And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.~)
(Mark,5,16,And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.~)
(Mark,5,17,And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.~)
(Mark,5,18,And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.~)
(Mark,5,19,Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.~)
(Mark,5,20,And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.~)
(Mark,5,21,And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.~)
(Mark,5,22,And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,~)
(Mark,5,23,And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.~)
(Mark,5,24,And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.~)
(Mark,5,25,And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,~)
(Mark,5,26,And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,~)
(Mark,5,27,When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.~)
(Mark,5,28,For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.~)
(Mark,5,29,And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.~)
(Mark,5,30,And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?~)
(Mark,5,31,And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?~)
(Mark,5,32,And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.~)
(Mark,5,33,But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.~)
(Mark,5,34,And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.~)
(Mark,5,35,While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?~)
(Mark,5,36,As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.~)
(Mark,5,37,And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.~)
(Mark,5,38,And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.~)
(Mark,5,39,And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.~)
(Mark,5,40,And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.~)
(Mark,5,41,And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.~)
(Mark,5,42,And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.~)
(Mark,5,43,And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.~)
(Mark,6,1,And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.~)
(Mark,6,2,And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?~)
(Mark,6,3,Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.~)
(Mark,6,4,But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.~)
(Mark,6,5,And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.~)
(Mark,6,6,And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.~)
(Mark,6,7,And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;~)
(Mark,6,8,And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:~)
(Mark,6,9,But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.~)
(Mark,6,10,And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.~)
(Mark,6,11,And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.~)
(Mark,6,12,And they went out, and preached that men should repent.~)
(Mark,6,13,And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.~)
(Mark,6,14,And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.~)
(Mark,6,15,Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.~)
(Mark,6,16,But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.~)
(Mark,6,17,For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her.~)
(Mark,6,18,For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife.~)
(Mark,6,19,Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:~)
(Mark,6,20,For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.~)
(Mark,6,21,And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;~)
(Mark,6,22,And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.~)
(Mark,6,23,And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.~)
(Mark,6,24,And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.~)
(Mark,6,25,And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.~)
(Mark,6,26,And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.~)
(Mark,6,27,And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,~)
(Mark,6,28,And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.~)
(Mark,6,29,And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.~)
(Mark,6,30,And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.~)
(Mark,6,31,And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.~)
(Mark,6,32,And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.~)
(Mark,6,33,And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.~)
(Mark,6,34,And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.~)
(Mark,6,35,And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:~)
(Mark,6,36,Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.~)
(Mark,6,37,He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?~)
(Mark,6,38,He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.~)
(Mark,6,39,And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.~)
(Mark,6,40,And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.~)
(Mark,6,41,And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.~)
(Mark,6,42,And they did all eat, and were filled.~)
(Mark,6,43,And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.~)
(Mark,6,44,And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.~)
(Mark,6,45,And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.~)
(Mark,6,46,And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.~)
(Mark,6,47,And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.~)
(Mark,6,48,And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.~)
(Mark,6,49,But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:~)
(Mark,6,50,For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.~)
(Mark,6,51,And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.~)
(Mark,6,52,For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.~)
(Mark,6,53,And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.~)
(Mark,6,54,And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,~)
(Mark,6,55,And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.~)
(Mark,6,56,And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.~)
(Mark,7,1,Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.~)
(Mark,7,2,And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.~)
(Mark,7,3,For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.~)
(Mark,7,4,And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.~)
(Mark,7,5,Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?~)
(Mark,7,6,He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.~)
(Mark,7,7,Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.~)
(Mark,7,8,For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.~)
(Mark,7,9,And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.~)
(Mark,7,10,For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:~)
(Mark,7,11,But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.~)
(Mark,7,12,And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;~)
(Mark,7,13,Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.~)
(Mark,7,14,And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:~)
(Mark,7,15,There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.~)
(Mark,7,16,If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.~)
(Mark,7,17,And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.~)
(Mark,7,18,And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;~)
(Mark,7,19,Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?~)
(Mark,7,20,And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.~)
(Mark,7,21,For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,~)
(Mark,7,22,Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:~)
(Mark,7,23,All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.~)
(Mark,7,24,And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.~)
(Mark,7,25,For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:~)
(Mark,7,26,The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.~)
(Mark,7,27,But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.~)
(Mark,7,28,And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.~)
(Mark,7,29,And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.~)
(Mark,7,30,And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.~)
(Mark,7,31,And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.~)
(Mark,7,32,And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.~)
(Mark,7,33,And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;~)
(Mark,7,34,And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.~)
(Mark,7,35,And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.~)
(Mark,7,36,And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;~)
(Mark,7,37,And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.~)
(Mark,8,1,In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,~)
(Mark,8,2,I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:~)
(Mark,8,3,And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.~)
(Mark,8,4,And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?~)
(Mark,8,5,And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.~)
(Mark,8,6,And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.~)
(Mark,8,7,And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them.~)
(Mark,8,8,So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets.~)
(Mark,8,9,And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.~)
(Mark,8,10,And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.~)
(Mark,8,11,And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.~)
(Mark,8,12,And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.~)
(Mark,8,13,And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.~)
(Mark,8,14,Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.~)
(Mark,8,15,And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.~)
(Mark,8,16,And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.~)
(Mark,8,17,And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?~)
(Mark,8,18,Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?~)
(Mark,8,19,When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.~)
(Mark,8,20,And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.~)
(Mark,8,21,And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?~)
(Mark,8,22,And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.~)
(Mark,8,23,And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.~)
(Mark,8,24,And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.~)
(Mark,8,25,After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.~)
(Mark,8,26,And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.~)
(Mark,8,27,And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?~)
(Mark,8,28,And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets.~)
(Mark,8,29,And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.~)
(Mark,8,30,And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.~)
(Mark,8,31,And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.~)
(Mark,8,32,And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.~)
(Mark,8,33,But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.~)
(Mark,8,34,And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.~)
(Mark,8,35,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.~)
(Mark,8,36,For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?~)
(Mark,8,37,Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?~)
(Mark,8,38,Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.~)
(Mark,9,1,And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.~)
(Mark,9,2,And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.~)
(Mark,9,3,And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.~)
(Mark,9,4,And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus.~)
(Mark,9,5,And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.~)
(Mark,9,6,For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.~)
(Mark,9,7,And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.~)
(Mark,9,8,And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.~)
(Mark,9,9,And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead.~)
(Mark,9,10,And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean.~)
(Mark,9,11,And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come?~)
(Mark,9,12,And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.~)
(Mark,9,13,But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.~)
(Mark,9,14,And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.~)
(Mark,9,15,And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.~)
(Mark,9,16,And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?~)
(Mark,9,17,And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;~)
(Mark,9,18,And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not.~)
(Mark,9,19,He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.~)
(Mark,9,20,And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.~)
(Mark,9,21,And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him?  And he said, Of a child.~)
(Mark,9,22,And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.~)
(Mark,9,23,Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.~)
(Mark,9,24,And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.~)
(Mark,9,25,When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.~)
(Mark,9,26,And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.~)
(Mark,9,27,But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.~)
(Mark,9,28,And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?~)
(Mark,9,29,And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.~)
(Mark,9,30,And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.~)
(Mark,9,31,For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.~)
(Mark,9,32,But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.~)
(Mark,9,33,And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?~)
(Mark,9,34,But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.~)
(Mark,9,35,And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.~)
(Mark,9,36,And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,~)
(Mark,9,37,Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.~)
(Mark,9,38,And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he followeth not us.~)
(Mark,9,39,But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.~)
(Mark,9,40,For he that is not against us is on our part.~)
(Mark,9,41,For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.~)
(Mark,9,42,And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.~)
(Mark,9,43,And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:~)
(Mark,9,44,Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.~)
(Mark,9,45,And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:~)
(Mark,9,46,Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.~)
(Mark,9,47,And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:~)
(Mark,9,48,Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.~)
(Mark,9,49,For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.~)
(Mark,9,50,Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.~)
(Mark,10,1,And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.~)
(Mark,10,2,And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.~)
(Mark,10,3,And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?~)
(Mark,10,4,And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.~)
(Mark,10,5,And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.~)
(Mark,10,6,But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.~)
(Mark,10,7,For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;~)
(Mark,10,8,And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh.~)
(Mark,10,9,What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.~)
(Mark,10,10,And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.~)
(Mark,10,11,And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her.~)
(Mark,10,12,And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.~)
(Mark,10,13,And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.~)
(Mark,10,14,But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.~)
(Mark,10,15,Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.~)
(Mark,10,16,And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.~)
(Mark,10,17,And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?~)
(Mark,10,18,And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.~)
(Mark,10,19,Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.~)
(Mark,10,20,And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.~)
(Mark,10,21,Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.~)
(Mark,10,22,And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions.~)
(Mark,10,23,And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!~)
(Mark,10,24,And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!~)
(Mark,10,25,It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.~)
(Mark,10,26,And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?~)
(Mark,10,27,And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.~)
(Mark,10,28,Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.~)
(Mark,10,29,And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,~)
(Mark,10,30,But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.~)
(Mark,10,31,But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.~)
(Mark,10,32,And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,~)
(Mark,10,33,Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:~)
(Mark,10,34,And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.~)
(Mark,10,35,And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.~)
(Mark,10,36,And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?~)
(Mark,10,37,They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.~)
(Mark,10,38,But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?~)
(Mark,10,39,And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:~)

(Mark,10,44,And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.~)
(Mark,10,45,For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.~)

(Mark,12,23,In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.~)
(Mark,12,24,And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?~)
(Mark,12,25,For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.~)
(Mark,12,26,And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?~)
(Mark,12,27,He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.~)

(Mark,12,32,And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:~)
(Mark,12,33,And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.~)
(Mark,12,34,And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.~)
(Mark,12,35,And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?~)

(Mark,12,40,Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.~)
(Mark,12,41,And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.~)
(Mark,12,42,And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.~)
(Mark,12,43,And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:~)

(Mark,13,1,And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!~)
(Mark,13,2,And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings?  there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.~)
(Mark,13,3,And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,~)
(Mark,13,4,Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?~)
(Mark,13,5,And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:~)
(Mark,13,6,For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.~)
(Mark,13,7,And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.~)

(Mark,13,10,And the gospel must first be published among all nations.~)
(Mark,13,11,But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.~)
(Mark,13,12,Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.~)
(Mark,13,13,And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.~)
(Mark,13,14,But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:~)
(Mark,13,15,And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:~)
(Mark,13,16,And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.~)
(Mark,13,17,But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!~)
(Mark,13,18,And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.~)
(Mark,13,19,For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.~)
(Mark,13,20,And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.~)
(Mark,13,21,And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:~)
(Mark,13,22,For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.~)
(Mark,13,23,But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.~)
(Mark,13,24,But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,~)
(Mark,13,25,And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.~)
(Mark,13,26,And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.~)
(Mark,13,27,And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.~)
(Mark,13,28,Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:~)
(Mark,13,29,So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.~)
(Mark,13,30,Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.~)
(Mark,13,31,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.~)
(Mark,13,32,But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.~)
(Mark,13,33,Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.~)
(Mark,13,34,For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.~)
(Mark,13,35,Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:~)
(Mark,13,36,Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.~)
(Mark,13,37,And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.~)
(Mark,14,1,After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.~)
(Mark,14,2,But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.~)
(Mark,14,3,And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head.~)
(Mark,14,4,And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?~)
(Mark,14,5,For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.~)
(Mark,14,6,And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.~)
(Mark,14,7,For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.~)
(Mark,14,8,She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.~)
(Mark,14,9,Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.~)
(Mark,14,10,And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.~)

(Mark,14,13,And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.~)
(Mark,14,14,And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?~)
(Mark,14,15,And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.~)
(Mark,14,16,And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.~)
(Mark,14,17,And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.~)
(Mark,14,18,And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.~)
(Mark,14,19,And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?~)
(Mark,14,20,And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.~)
(Mark,14,21,The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.~)
(Mark,14,22,And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.~)
(Mark,14,23,And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.~)
(Mark,14,24,And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.~)
(Mark,14,25,Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.~)

(Mark,14,29,But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.~)
(Mark,14,30,And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.~)
(Mark,14,31,But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.~)
(Mark,14,32,And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.~)
(Mark,14,33,And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;~)
(Mark,14,34,And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.~)
(Mark,14,35,And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.~)
(Mark,14,36,And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.~)
(Mark,14,37,And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?~)
(Mark,14,38,Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.~)
(Mark,14,39,And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.~)
(Mark,14,40,And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.~)
(Mark,14,41,And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.~)
(Mark,14,42,Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.~)
(Mark,14,43,And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.~)
(Mark,14,44,And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.~)

(Mark,14,55,And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.~)
(Mark,14,56,For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.~)
(Mark,14,57,And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,~)
(Mark,14,58,We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.~)
(Mark,14,59,But neither so did their witness agree together.~)
(Mark,14,60,And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?~)
(Mark,14,61,But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?~)
(Mark,14,62,And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.~)
(Mark,14,63,Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?~)
(Mark,14,64,Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.~)
(Mark,14,65,And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.~)
(Mark,14,66,And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:~)
(Mark,14,67,And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.~)
(Mark,14,68,But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.~)
(Mark,14,69,And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.~)
(Mark,14,70,And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.~)
(Mark,14,71,But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.~)
(Mark,14,72,And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.~)

(Mark,15,6,Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.~)
(Mark,15,7,And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.~)
(Mark,15,8,And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.~)
(Mark,15,9,But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?~)
(Mark,15,10,For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.~)
(Mark,15,11,But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.~)
(Mark,15,12,And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?~)
(Mark,15,13,And they cried out again, Crucify him.~)
(Mark,15,14,Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.~)
(Mark,15,15,And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.~)
(Mark,15,16,And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.~)
(Mark,15,17,And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,~)
(Mark,15,18,And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!~)
(Mark,15,19,And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.~)
(Mark,15,20,And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.~)
(Mark,15,21,And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.~)
(Mark,15,22,And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.~)
(Mark,15,23,And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.~)
(Mark,15,24,And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.~)
(Mark,15,25,And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.~)
(Mark,15,26,And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.~)
(Mark,15,27,And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.~)
(Mark,15,28,And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.~)
(Mark,15,29,And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,~)
(Mark,15,30,Save thyself, and come down from the cross.~)
(Mark,15,31,Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.~)
(Mark,15,32,Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.~)
(Mark,15,33,And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.~)
(Mark,15,34,And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?~)
(Mark,15,35,And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.~)
(Mark,15,36,And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.~)
(Mark,15,37,And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.~)
(Mark,15,38,And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.~)
(Mark,15,39,And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.~)
(Mark,15,40,There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;~)
(Mark,15,41,(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.~)
(Mark,15,42,And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,~)
(Mark,15,43,Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.~)
(Mark,15,44,And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.~)
(Mark,15,45,And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.~)
(Mark,15,46,And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.~)
(Mark,15,47,And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.~)
(Mark,16,1,And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.~)
(Mark,16,2,And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.~)
(Mark,16,3,And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?~)
(Mark,16,4,And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.~)
(Mark,16,5,And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.~)
(Mark,16,6,And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.~)
(Mark,16,7,But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.~)
(Mark,16,8,And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid.~)
(Mark,16,9,Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.~)
(Mark,16,10,And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.~)
(Mark,16,11,And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.~)
(Mark,16,12,After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.~)
(Mark,16,13,And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.~)
(Mark,16,14,Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.~)
(Mark,16,15,And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.~)
(Mark,16,16,He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.~)
(Mark,16,17,And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;~)
(Mark,16,18,They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.~)
(Mark,16,19,So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.~)
(Mark,16,20,And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.~)
(James,1,1,James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.~)
(James,1,2,My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;~)
(James,1,3,Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.~)
(James,1,4,But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.~)
(James,1,5,If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.~)
(James,1,6,But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.~)
(James,1,7,For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.~)
(James,1,8,A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.~)
(James,1,9,Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:~)
(James,1,10,But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.~)
(James,1,11,For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.~)
(James,1,12,Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.~)
(James,1,13,Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:~)
(James,1,14,But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.~)
(James,1,15,Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.~)
(James,1,16,Do not err, my beloved brethren.~)
(James,1,17,Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.~)
(James,1,18,Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.~)
(James,1,19,Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:~)
(James,1,20,For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.~)
(James,1,21,Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.~)
(James,1,22,But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.~)
(James,1,23,For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:~)
(James,1,24,For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.~)
(James,1,25,But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.~)
(James,1,26,If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.~)
(James,1,27,Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.~)
(James,2,1,My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.~)
(James,2,2,For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;~)
(James,2,3,And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:~)
(James,2,4,Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?~)
(James,2,5,Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?~)
(James,2,6,But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?~)
(James,2,7,Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?~)
(James,2,8,If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:~)
(James,2,9,But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.~)
(James,2,10,For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.~)
(James,2,11,For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.~)
(James,2,12,So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.~)
(James,2,13,For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.~)
(James,2,14,What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?~)
(James,2,15,If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,~)
(James,2,16,And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?~)
(James,2,17,Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.~)
(James,2,18,Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.~)
(James,2,19,Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.~)
(James,2,20,But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?~)
(James,2,21,Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?~)
(James,2,22,Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?~)
(James,2,23,And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.~)
(James,2,24,Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.~)
(James,2,25,Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?~)
(James,2,26,For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.~)
(James,3,1,My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.~)
(James,3,2,For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.~)
(James,3,3,Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.~)
(James,3,4,Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.~)
(James,3,5,Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!~)
(James,3,6,And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.~)
(James,3,7,For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:~)
(James,3,8,But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.~)
(James,3,9,Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.~)
(James,3,10,Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.~)
(James,3,11,Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?~)
(James,3,12,Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.~)
(James,3,13,Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.~)
(James,3,14,But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.~)
(James,3,15,This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.~)
(James,3,16,For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.~)
(James,3,17,But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.~)
(James,3,18,And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.~)
(James,4,1,From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?~)
(James,4,2,Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.~)
(James,4,3,Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.~)
(James,4,4,Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.~)
(James,4,5,Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?~)
(James,4,6,But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.~)
(James,4,7,Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.~)
(James,4,8,Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.~)
(James,4,9,Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.~)
(James,4,10,Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.~)
(James,4,11,Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.~)
(James,4,12,There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?~)
(James,4,13,Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:~)
(James,4,14,Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.~)
(James,4,15,For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.~)
(James,4,16,But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.~)
(James,4,17,Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.~)
(James,5,1,Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.~)
(James,5,2,Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.~)
(James,5,3,Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.~)
(James,5,4,Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.~)
(James,5,5,Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.~)
(James,5,6,Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.~)
(James,5,7,Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.~)
(James,5,8,Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.~)
(James,5,9,Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.~)
(James,5,10,Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.~)
(James,5,11,Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.~)
(James,5,12,But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.~)
(James,5,13,Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.~)
(James,5,14,Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:~)
(James,5,15,And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.~)
(James,5,16,Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.~)
(James,5,17,Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.~)
(James,5,18,And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.~)
(James,5,19,Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;~)
(James,5,20,Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.~)
